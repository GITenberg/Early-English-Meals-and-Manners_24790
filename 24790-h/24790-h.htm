<p>This e-text includes characters that will only display in UTF-8
(Unicode) file encoding:</p>

<p class = "inset">
ȝ (yogh)<br>
œ (oe ligature)</p>

<p>There are also a few lines of Greek, and some rarer characters used
only in one or two selections:</p>

<p class = "inset">
ſ (long s)<br>
ł, đ (l, d with bar)<br>
m̅ (m with overline)</p>

<p>If these characters do not display properly, or if the apostrophes
and quotation marks in this paragraph appear as garbage, you may have an
incompatible browser or unavailable fonts. First, make sure that the
browser’s “character set” or “file encoding” is set to Unicode (UTF-8).
You may also need to change your browser’s default font.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>The text is intended to reproduce the layout of the original as
closely as possible. If you see a horizontal scroll bar, it may help to
make your browser window <i>narrower</i> (not wider).</p>

<p><b>Headnotes</b> were printed at the top of alternate pages, like
subsidiary chapter headings. They have been retained in the introductory
section but were omitted from the main text to reduce visual
clutter.</p>

<p><b>Text-Critical Notes</b> and variant readings have been handled
differently than in the printed book, where they appeared either as
footnotes (numbered) or sidenotes (sometimes but not always marked).
Here, the word they refer to is <span class =
"texttag">underlined</span> if necessary, and the note itself will
generally have this form:</p>

France is the organized whole of the higher and middle institutions of
learning, in so far as they are directed by the State, not the clergy.
It is an institution more governmental, according to the genius of the
country, than our London University, to which, however, its organization
bears some resemblance. To speak of it in one breath with Oxford or
Aberdeen is to commit the ... error of confounding two things, or

statement about the law school no authority whatever beyond his general
reference throughout to Anthony Wood. But the fact is as historical as a
fact can well be, and the authority for it is a passage in one of the
best of the contemporary authors, Gervaise of Canterbury. “Tunc leges et

is called in many places God’s Sunday. Know well that it is the manner
in every place of worship at this day <i>to do the fire out of the
hall;</i> and the black winter brands, and all thing that is foul with
smoke shall be done away, and there the fire was, shall be gaily arrayed
with fair flowers, and strewed with green rushes all about, showing a
great ensample to all Christian people, like as they make clean their
houses to the sight of the people, in the same wise ye should cleanse
your souls, doing away the foul brenning (burning) sin of lechery; put
all these away, and cast out all thy smoke, dusts; and strew in your
souls flowers of faith and charity, and thus make your souls able to
receive your Lord God at the Feast of Easter.” &mdash;Rock’s <i>Church
of the Future</i>, v. iii. pt. 2, p.&nbsp;250. “The holly, being an
evergreen, would be more fit for the purpose, and makes less litter,
than the boughs of deciduous trees. I&nbsp;know some old folks in
Herefordshire who yet follow the custom, and keep the grate filled with
flowers and foliage till late in the autumn.” &mdash;D.&nbsp;R. On
Shere-Thursday, or <i>Cena Domini</i>, Dr Rock quotes from the <i>Liber
Festivalis</i>&mdash;“First if a man asked why Sherethursday is called
so, ye may say that in Holy Church it is called ‘Cena Domini,’ our
Lord’s Supper Day; for that day he supped with his disciples openly....
It is also in English called Sherethursday; for in old fathers’ days the
people would that day sheer their heads and clip their beards, and poll
their heads, and so make them honest against Easter-day.” &mdash;Rock,

Russell’s <i>Boke of Nurture</i></a></h4>

<p>In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, God keep me! I am an
Usher to a Prince, and delight in teaching the inexperienced.</p>
<p>It is charitable to teach ignorant youths.</p>
<p>If any such won’t learn, give them a toy.</p>
<p>One May I went to a forest, and by the Forester’s leave walked in the
woodland, where I saw three herds of deer in the sunshine.</p>
<p>A young man with a bow was going to stalk them, but I asked him to
walk with me, and inquired whom he served.</p>
<p>‘No one but myself, and I wish I was out of this world.’</p>
<p>‘Good son, despair is sin; tell me what the matter is. When the pain
is greatest the cure is nearest!’</p>
<p>‘Sir, I’ve tried everywhere for a master; but because I know nothing,
no one will take me.’</p>
<p>‘Will you learn if I’ll teach you? What do you want to be?’</p>
<p>‘A Butler, Sir, Panter, Chamberlain, and Carver. Teach me the duties
of these.’</p>
<p>‘I will, if you’ll love God and be true to your master.’</p>
<p>A Panter or Butler must have three knives:</p>
<p class = "inset">
1 to chop loaves, 1 to pare them, 1 to smooth the trenchers.</p>
<p>Give your Sovereign new bread, others one-day-old bread; for the
house, three-day bread; for trenchers four-day bread; Have your salt
white, and your salt-planer of ivory, two inches broad, three long.</p>
<p>Have your table linen sweet and clean, your knives bright, spoons
well washed, two wine-augers some box taps, a broaching gimlet, a pipe
and bung.</p>
<p>To broach a pipe, pierce it with an auger or gimlet, four fingers-
breadth over the lower rim, so that the dregs may not rise.</p>
<p>Serve Fruit according to the season, figs, dates, quince-marmalade,
ginger, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Before dinner, plums and grapes after, pears, nuts, and hard
cheese.</p>
<p>After supper, roast apples, &amp;c.</p>
<p>In the evening don’t take cream, strawberries, or junket, unless you
eat hard cheese with them.</p>
<p>Hard cheese keeps your bowels open.</p>
<p>Butter is wholesome in youth and old age, anti-poisonous, and
aperient.</p>
<p>Milk, Junket, Posset, &amp;c., are binding.</p>
<p>Eat hard cheese after them.</p>
<p>Beware of green meat; it weakens your belly.</p>
<p>For food that sets your teeth on edge, eat almonds and cheese, but
not more than half an ounce.</p>
<p>If drinks have given you indigestion, eat a raw apple.</p>
<p>Moderation is best sometimes, at others abstinence.</p>
<p>Look every night that your wines don’t ferment or leak Always carry a
gimlet, adze, and linen cloths; and wash the heads of the pipes with
cold water.</p>
<p>If the wine boil over, put to it the lees of red wine, and that will
cure it.</p>
<p>Romney will bring round sick sweet wine.</p>

<h5>The names of Sweet Wines.</h5>

<h5>Recipe for making Ypocras.</h5>
<p>Take spices thus, Cinnamon, &amp;c., long Pepper.</p>
<p>Have three basins and three straining-bags to them; hang ’em on a
perch.</p>
<p>Let your ginger be well pared, hard, not worm-eaten, (Colombyne is
better than Valadyne or Maydelyne); your sticks of Cinnamon thin, hot
and sweet; Canel is not so good.</p>
<p>Cinnamon is hot and dry, Cardamons are hot and moist.</p>
<p>Take sugar or sugar candy, red wine, graines, ginger, pepper,
cinnamon, spice, and turnesole, and put each powder in a bladder by
itself.</p>
<p>Hang your straining-bags so that they mayn’t touch,--first bag a
gallon, others a pottle.</p>
<p>Put the powders in two or three gallons of red wine; then into the
runner, the second bag, (tasting and trying it now and then), and the
third vessel.</p>
<p>If it’s not right, add cinnamon, ginger, or sugar, as wanted.</p>
<p>If it’s not right, add cinnamon, ginger, or sugar, as wanted.</p>
<p>Mind you keep tasting it.</p>
<p>Strain it through bags of fine cloth, hooped at the mouth, the first
holding a gallon, the others a pottle, and each with a basin under
it.</p>
<p>The Ypocras is made.</p>
<p>Use the dregs in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Put the Ypocras in a tight clean vessel, and serve it with
wafers.</p>

<h5>The Buttery.</h5>
<p>Keep all cups, &amp;c., clean.</p>
<p>Don’t serve ale till it’s five days old.</p>
<p>Be civil and obliging, and give no one stale drink.</p>

<h5>To lay the cloth, &amp;c.</h5>
<p>Wipe the table.</p>
<p>Put a cloth on it (a cowche); you take one end, your mate the other;
lay the fold of the second cloth(?) on the outer edge of the table, that
of the third cloth(?) on the inner.</p>
<p>Cover your cupboard with a diaper towel, put one round your neck, one
side on your left arm with your sovereign’s napkin; on that, eight
loaves to eat, and three or four trencher loaves: in your left the
salt-cellar.</p>
<p>In your right hand, spoons and knives.</p>
<p>Put the Salt on the right of your lord; on its left, a trencher or
two; on their left, a knife, then white rolls, and beside them a spoon
folded in a napkin.</p>
<p>Cover all up.</p>
<p>At the other end set a Salt and two trenchers.</p>

<h5>How to wrap up your lord’s bread in a stately way.</h5>
<p>Cut your loaves all equal.</p>
<p>Take a towel two and a half yards long by the ends, fold up a handful
from each end, and in the middle of the folds lay eight loaves or buns,
bottom to bottom; put a wrapper on the top, twist the ends of the towel
together, smooth your wrapper, and quickly open the end of it before
your lord.</p>
<p>After your lord’s lay the other tables.</p>
<p>Deck your cupboard with plate, your washing-table with basins,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Have plenty of napkins, &amp;c., and your pots clean.</p>
<p>Make the <i>Surnape</i> with a cloth under a double napkin.</p>
<p>Fold the two ends of your towel, and one of the cloth, a foot over,
and lay it smooth for your lord to wash with.</p>
<p>The marshal must slip it along the table, and pull it smooth.</p>
<p>Then raise the upper part of the towel, and lay it even, so that the
Sewer (arranger of dishes) may make a state.</p>
<p>When your lord has washed, take up the Surnape with your two arms,
and carry it back to the Ewery.</p>
<p>Carry a towel round your neck.</p>
<p>Uncover your bread; see that all diners have knife, spoon, and
napkin.</p>
<p>Bow when you leave your lord.</p>
<p>Take eight loaves from the bread-cloth, and put four at each end.</p>
<p>Lay for as many persons as the Sewer has set potages for, and have
plenty of bread and drink.</p>
<p>Be lively and soft-spoken, clean and well dressed.</p>
<p>Don’t spit or put your fingers into cups.</p>
<p>Stop all blaming and backbiting, and prevent complaints.</p>

<h5>General Directions for Behaviour.</h5>
<p>Don’t claw your back as if after a flea; or your head, as if after a
louse.</p>
<p>See that your eyes are not blinking and watery.</p>
<p>Don’t pick your nose, or let it drop, or blow it too loud, or twist
your neck.</p>
<p>Don’t claw your cods, rub your hands, pick your ears, retch, or spit
too far.</p>
<p>Don’t tell lies, or squirt with your mouth, gape, pout, or put your
tongue in a dish to pick dust out.</p>
<p>Don’t cough, hiccup, or belch, straddle your legs, or scrub your
body.</p>
<p>Don’t pick your teeth, cast stinking breath on your lord, fire your
stern guns, or expose your codware before your master.</p>
<p>Many other improprieties a good servant will avoid.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, pray teach me how to carve, handle a knife, and cut up birds,
fish, and flesh.’</p>
<p>‘Hold your knife tight, with two fingers and a thumb, in your
midpalm.</p>
<p>Do your carving, lay your bread, and take off trenchers, with two
fingers and thumb.</p>
<p>Never touch others’ food with your right hand, but only with the
left.</p>
<p>Don’t dirty your table or wipe your knives on it.</p>
<p>Take a loaf of trenchers, and with the edge of your knife raise a
trencher, and lay it before your lord; lay four trenchers four-square,
and another on the top.</p>
<p>Take a loaf of light bread, pare the edges, cut the upper crust for
your lord, and don’t touch it after it’s trimmed.</p>
<p>Keep your table clean.</p>

<h5>Indigestibilities.</h5>
<p>You must know what meat is indigestible, and what sauces are
wholesome.</p>
<p>These things are indigestible: Fat and Fried, Raw and Resty, Salt and
Sour, also sinews, skin, hair, feathers, crops, heads, pinions, &amp;c.,
legs, outsides of thighs, skins; these destroy your lord’s rest.’</p>
<p>‘Thanks, father, I’ll put your teaching into practice, and pray for
you.</p>
<p>But please tell me how to carve fish and flesh.’</p>

<h5>Carving of Meat.</h5>
<p>Cut <i>brawn</i> on the dish, and lift slices off with your knife;
serve it with mustard.</p>
<p>Venison with furmity.</p>
<p>Touch <i>Venison</i> only with your knife, pare it, cross it with 12
scores, cut a piece out, and put it in the furmity soup.</p>
<p>Touch with your left hand, pare it clean, put away the sinews,
&amp;c.</p>
<p><i>Partridges</i>, &amp;c.: take up by the pinion, and mince them
small in the sirrup.</p>
<p>Larger roast birds, as the <i>Osprey</i>, &amp;c., raise up [? cut
off] the legs, then the wings, lay the body in the middle, with the
wings and legs round it, in the same dish.</p>
<p><i>Capons:</i> take off the wings and legs; pour on ale or wine,
mince them into the flavoured sauce.</p>
<p>Give your lord the left wing, and if he want it, the right one
too.</p>
<p><i>Pheasants</i>, &amp;c.: take off the wings, put them in the dish,
then the legs.</p>
<p><i>Woodcocks</i>, Heronshaws, Brew, &amp;c.</p>
break the pinions, neck, and beak.
<p>Cut off the legs, then the wings, lay the body between them.</p>
<p><i>Crane</i>: take off the wings, but not the trompe in his
breast.</p>
<p><i>Peacocks</i>, &amp;c.: carve like you do the Crane, keeping their
feet on.</p>
<p><i>Quails</i>, larks, pigeons: give your lord the legs first.</p>
<p><i>Fawn</i>: serve the kidney first, then a rib.</p>
<p>Pick the fyxfax out of the neck.</p>
<p><i>Pig:</i></p>
<div class = "inset">
<p>1. shoulder,</p>
<p>2. rib.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Rabbit</i>: lay him on his back; pare off his skin; break his
haunch bone, cut him down each side of the back, lay him on his belly,
separate the sides from the chine, put them together again, cutting out
the nape of the neck; give your lord the sides.</p>
<p>Sucking rabbits: cut in two, then the hind part in two; pare the skin
off, serve the daintiest bit from the side.</p>
<p>Such is the way of carving gross meats.</p>
<p>Cut each piece into four slices (?) for your master to dip in his
sauce.</p>
<p>Of large birds’ wings, put only three bits at once in the sauce.</p>
<p>Of small birds’ wings, scrape the flesh to the end of the bone, and
put it on your lord’s trencher.</p>

<h5>How to carve Baked Meats.</h5>
<p>Open hot ones at the top of the crust, cold ones in the middle.</p>
<p>Take Teal, &amp;c., out of their pie, and mince their wings, stir the
gravy in; your lord may eat it with a spoon.</p>
<p>Cut Venison, &amp;c., in the pasty.</p>
<p>Custard: cut in squares with a knife.</p>
<p>Dowcets: pare away the sides; serve in a sawcer.</p>
<p>Payne-puff: pare the bottom, cut off the top.</p>
<p>Fried things are indigestible.</p>
<p>Poached-egg (?) fritters are best.</p>
<p>Tansey is good hot.</p>
<p>Don’t eat Leessez.</p>
<p>Cooks are always inventing new dishes that tempt people and endanger
their lives: Syrups Comedies, Jellies, that stop the bowels.</p>
<p>Some dishes are prepared with unclarified honey.</p>
<p>Cow-heels and Calves’ feet are sometimes mixed with unsugared leches
and Jellies.</p>
<p>Furmity with venison, mortrewes, jussell, &amp;c., are good.</p>
<p>Other out-of-the-way soups set aside.</p>
<p>Such is a flesh feast in the English way.</p>
<p>Sauces.</p>
<p>Sauces provoke a fine appetite.</p>
<p>Have ready Mustard for brawn, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>Verjuice for veal, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>Chawdon for cygnet and swan, Garlic, &amp;c., for beef and goose,
Ginger for fawn, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>Mustard and sugar for pheasant, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>Gamelyn for heronsew, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>Sugar and Salt for brew, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>Gamelyn for bustard, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>Salt and Cinnamon for woodcock, thrushes, &amp;c., and quails,
&amp;c.</p>

<h5>How to carve Fish.</h5>
<p>With pea soup or furmity serve a Beaver’s tail, salt Porpoise,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Split up Herrings, take out the roe and bones, eat with mustard.</p>
<p>Take the skin off salt fish, Salmon, Ling, &amp;c., and let the sauce
be mustard, but for Mackarel, &amp;c., butter of Claynes or Hackney (?)
Of Pike, the belly is best, with plenty of sauce.</p>
<p>Salt Lampreys, cut in seven gobbets, pick out the backbones, serve
with onions and galentine.</p>
<p>Plaice: cut off the fins, cross it with a knife, sauce with wine,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Gurnard, Chub, Roach, Dace, Cod, &amp;c., split up and spread on the
dish.</p>
<p>Soles, Carp, &amp;c., take off as served.</p>
<p>Whale, porpoise, congur, turbot, Halybut, &amp;c., cut in the dish,
and also Tench in jelly.</p>
<p>On roast Lamprons cast vinegar, &amp;c., and bone them.</p>
<p>Crabs are hard to carve: break every claw, put all the meat in the
body-shell, and then season it with <i>vinegar or verjuice</i> and
powder.</p>
<p>(?) Heat it, and give it to your lord.</p>
<p>Put the claws, broken, in a dish.</p>
<p>The sea Crayfish: cut it asunder, slit the belly of the back part,
take out the fish, clean out the <i>gowt</i> in the middle of the sea
Crayfish’s back; pick it out, tear it off the fish, and put vinegar to
it; break the claws and set them on the table.</p>
<p>Treat the back like the crab, stopping both ends with bread.</p>
<p>The fresh-water Crayfish: serve with vinegar and powder.</p>
<p>Salt Sturgeon: slit its joll, or head, thin.</p>
<p>Whelk: cut off its head and tail, throw away its operculum, mantle,
&amp;c., cut it in two, and put it on the sturgeon, adding vinegar.</p>
<p>Carve Baked Lampreys thus: take off the piecrust, put thin slices of
bread on a Dish, pour galentyne over the bread, add cinnamon and red
wine.</p>
<p>Mince the lampreys, lay them on the sauce, &amp;c., on a hot plate,
serve up to your lord.</p>
<p>White herrings fresh; the roe must be white and tender serve with
salt and wine.</p>
<p>Shrimps picked, lay them round a sawcer, and serve with vinegar.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, father, I know about Carving now, but I hardly dare ask you
about a Sewer’s duties, how he is to serve.”</p>

<h5>The Duties of a Sewer.</h5>

<h5>How to prepare a Bath.</h5>

<p>3. Master of the Rolls.</p>
<p>4. Puisné Judge.</p>
<p>5. Clerk of the Crown.</p>
<p>6. Mayor of Calais.</p>
<p>7. Doctor of Divinity.</p>
<p>8. Prothonotary.</p>
<p>9. Pope’s Legate.</p>
</div>
<p>V. (The Squire’s rank.)</p>
<div class = "inset">
<p>1. Doctor of Laws.</p>
<p>2. Ex-Mayor of London.</p>
<p>3. Serjeant of Law.</p>
<p>4. Masters of Chancery.</p>
<p>5. Preacher.</p>
<p>6. Masters of Arts.</p>
<p>7. Other Religious.</p>
<p>8. Parsons and Vicars.</p>
<p>9. Parish Priests.</p>
<p>10. City Bailiffs.</p>
<p>11. Serjeant at Arms.</p>
<p>12. Heralds (the chief Herald has first place),</p>
<p>13. Merchants,</p>
<p>14. Gentlemen,</p>
<p>15. Gentlewomen may all eat with squires.</p>
</div>
<p>I have now told you the rank of every class, and now I’ll tell you
how they may be grouped at table.</p>
<p>I. Pope, King, Prince, Archbishop and Duke.</p>
<p>II. Bishop, Marquis, Viscount, Earl.</p>
<p>III. The Mayor of London, Baron, Mitred Abbot, three Chief Justices,
Speaker, may sit together, two or three at a mess.</p>
<p>IV. The other ranks (three or four to a mess) equal to a Knight,
unmitred Abbot, Dean, Master of the Rolls, under Judges, Doctor of
Divinity, Prothonotary, Mayor of Calais.</p>
<p>V. Other ranks equal to a Squire, four to a mess.</p>
<p>Serjeants of Law, ex-Mayor of London, Masters of Chancery, Preachers
and Parsons, Apprentices of Law, Merchants and Franklins.</p>
<p>Each estate or rank shall sit at meat by itself, not seeing
another.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Canterbury shall be served apart from the Archbishop of
York, and the Metropolitan alone.</p>
<p>The Bishop of York must not eat before the Primate of England.</p>
<p>Sometimes a Marshal is puzzled by Lords of royal blood being poor,
and others not royal being rich; also by a Lady of royal blood marrying
a knight, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>
<p>The Lady of royal blood shall keep her rank; the Lady of low blood
shall take her husband’s rank.</p>
<p>Property is not so worthy as royal blood, so the latter prevails over
the former, for royal blood may become King.</p>
<p>The parents of a Pope or Cardinal must not presume to equality with
their son, and must not want to sit by him, but in a separate room.</p>
<p>A Marshal must look to the rank of every estate, and do honour to
<i>foreign visitors</i> and residents.</p>
<p>A well-trained Marshal should think beforehand where to place
strangers at the table.</p>
<p>If the King sends any messenger to your Lord receive him one degree
higher than his rank.</p>
<p>The King’s groom may dine with a Knight or Marshal, A Marshal must
also understand the rank of County and Borough officers, and that a
Knight of blood and property is above a poor Knight, the Mayor of London
above the Mayor of Queenborough, the Abbot of Westminster above the poor
Abbot of Tintern, the Prior of Canterbury above the Prior of Dudley, the
Prior who is Prelate of a Cathedral Church above any Abbot or Prior of
his diocese, a Doctor of 12 years’ standing above one of 9 (though the
latter be the richer), the old Aldermen above the young ones, and</p>
<div class = "inset">
<p>1. the Master of a craft,</p>
<p>2. the ex-warden.</p>
</div>
<p>Before every feast, then, think what people are coming, and settle
what their order of precedence is to be.</p>
<p>If in doubt, ask your lord or the chief officer, and then you’ll do
wrong to no one, but set all according to their birth and dignity.</p>
<p>Now I have told you of Court Manners, how to manage in Pantry,
Buttery, Carving, and as Sewer, and Marshal, as I learnt with a Royal
Prince whose Usher and Marshal I was.</p>
<p>All other officers have to obey me.</p>
<p>Our office is the chief, whether the Cook likes it or not.</p>
<p>All these offices may be filled by one man, but a Prince’s dignity
requires each office to have its officer, and a servant under him, (all
knowing their duties perfectly) to wait on their Lord and please his
guests.</p>
<p>Don’t fear to serve a prince; take good heed to your duties, watch,
and you need not fear.</p>
<p><i>Tasting</i> is done only for those of royal blood, as a Pope,
King, Duke, and Earl: not below.</p>
<p>Tasting is done for fear of poison; therefore keep your room secure,
and close your safe, for fear of tricks.</p>
<p>A Prince’s Steward and Chamberlain have the oversight of all offices
and of tasting, and they must tell the Marshal, Sewer, and Carver how to
do it.</p>
<p>I don’t propose to write more on this matter.</p>
<p>I tried this treatise myself, in my youth, and enjoyed these matters,
but now age compels me to leave the court; so try yourself.”</p>
<p>“Blessing on you, Father, for this your teaching of me! Now I shall
dare to serve where before I was afraid. I will try, and shall learn by
practice. May God reward you for teaching me!”</p>
<p>“Good son, and all readers of this <i>Boke of Nurture</i>, pray for
the soul of me, John Russell, (servant of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester;)
also for the Duke, my wife, father, and mother, that we may all go to
bliss when we die.”</p>
<p>Little book, commend me to all learners, and to the experienced, whom
I pray to correct its faults.</p>
<p>Any such, put to my copying, which I have done as I best could.</p>
<p>The transcriber is not to blame; he copied what was before him, and
neither of us wrote it, I only corrected the rhyme.</p>
<p>God! grant us grace to rule in Heaven with Thine elect!</p>

<p>A Cardinal before a Prince.</p>
<p>The Mayor of London ranks with the 3 Chief Justices.</p>
<p>The Knight’s equals.</p>
<p>The ex-Mayor of London.</p>
<p>The Esquire’s equals. Who must dine alone, who 2 together, who 2 or
3, who 3 or 4. The Marshall must know who are of royal blood, for that
has the reverence. He must take heed of the King’s officers, do honour
to strangers, and receive a Messenger from the King as if one degree
higher than he is, for a King’s groom may sit at a Knight’s table.</p>


<h4><a name = "side_curtasye" id = "side_curtasye">
The Boke of Curtasye</a></h4>

<p>In this book you may learn Courtesy. Every one needs it.</p>
<p>On reaching a Lord’s gate, give the Porter your weapon, and ask leave
to go in.</p>
<p>If the master is of low degree, he will come to you: if of high, the
Porter will take you to him.</p>
<p>At the Hall-door, take off your hood and gloves, greet the Steward,
&amp;c., at the dais, bow to the Gentlemen on each side of the hall both
right and left; notice the yeomen, then stand before the screen till the
Marshal or Usher leads you to the table.</p>
<p>Be sedate and courteous if you are set with the gentlemen.</p>
<p>Cut your loaf in two, the top from the bottom; cut the top crust in
4, and the bottom in 3. cut the top crust in 4, and the bottom in 3.</p>
<p>Put your trencher before you, and don’t eat or drink till your Mess
is brought from the kitchen, lest you be thought starved or a
glutton.</p>
<p>Have your nails clean.</p>
<p>Don’t bite your bread, but break it.</p>
<p>Don’t quarrel at table, or make grimaces.</p>
<p>Don’t cram your cheeks out with food like an ape, for if any one
should speak to you, you can’t answer, but must wait.</p>
<p>Don’t eat on both sides of your mouth.</p>
<p>Don’t laugh with your mouth full, or sup up your potage noisily.</p>
<p>Don’t leave your spoon in the dish or on its side, but clean your
spoon.</p>
<p>Let no dirt off your fingers soil the cloth.</p>
<p>Don’t put into the dish bread that you have once bitten.</p>
<p>Dry your mouth before you drink.</p>
<p>Don’t call for a dish once removed, or spit on the table: that’s
rude.</p>
<p>Don’t scratch your dog.</p>
<p>If you blow your nose, clean your hand; wipe it with your skirt or
put it through your tippet.</p>
<p>Don’t pick your teeth at meals, or drink with food in your mouth, as
you may get choked, or killed, by its stopping your wind.</p>
<p>Tell no tale to harm or shame your companions.</p>
<p>Don’t stroke the cat or dog.</p>
<p>Don’t dirty the table cloth with your knife.</p>
<p>Don’t blow on your food, or put your knife in your mouth, or wipe
your teeth or eyes with the table cloth.</p>
<p>If you sit by a good man, don’t put your knee under his thigh.</p>
<p>Don’t hand your cup to any one with your back towards him.</p>
<p>Don’t lean on your elbow, or dip your thumb into your drink, or your
food into the salt cellar:
That is a vice.</p>
<p>Don’t spit in the basin you wash in or loosely (?) before a man of
God.</p>

<p>If you go to school you shall learn:</p>
<div class = "inset">
<p>1. Cross of Christ,</p>
<p>2. Pater Noster,</p>
<p>3. Hail Mary and the Creed,</p>
<p>4. In the name of the Trinity,</p>
<p>5. of the Apostles,</p>
<p>6. the Confession.</p>
</div>
<p>Seek the kingdom of God, and worship Him.</p>
<p>At church, take holy water; pray for all Christian companions; kneel
to God on both knees, to man only on one.</p>
<p>At the Altar, serve the priest with both hands.</p>
<p>Speak gently to your father and mother, and honour them.</p>
<p>Do to others as you would they should do to you.</p>
<p>Don’t be foolishly meek.</p>
<p>The seed of the righteous shall never beg or be shamed.</p>
<p>Be ready forgive, and fond of peace.</p>
<p>If you cannot give an asker goods, give him good words.</p>
<p>Be willing to help every one.</p>
<p>Give your partner his fair share.</p>
<p>Go on the pilgrimages (?) you vow to saints, lest God take vengeance
on you.</p>
<p>Don’t believe all who speak fair: the Serpent spoke fair words (to
Eve).</p>
<p>Be cautious with your words, except when angry.</p>
<p>Don’t lie, but keep your word.</p>
<p>Don’t laugh too often, or you’ll be called a shrew or a fool.</p>
<p>Man’s 3 enemies are: the Devil, the Flesh, and the World.</p>
<p>Destroy these, and be sure of heaven.</p>
<p>Don’t strive with your lord, or bet or play with him.</p>
<p>In a strange place don’t be too inquisitive or fussy.</p>
<p>If a man falls, don’t laugh, but help him up: your own head may fall
to your feet.</p>
<p>At the Mass, if the priest doesn’t please you, don’t blame him.</p>
<p>Don’t tell your secrets to a shrew.</p>
<p>Don’t beckon, point, or whisper.</p>
<p>When you meet a man, greet him, or answer him cheerily if he greets
you:
don’t be dumb, lest men say you have no mouth.</p>
<p>Never speak improperly of women, for we and our fathers were all born
of women.</p>
<p>A wife should honour and obey her husband, and serve him.</p>
<p>Try to reconcile brothers if they quarrel.</p>
<p>At a gate, let your equal precede you; go behind your superior and
your master unless he bids you go beside him.</p>
<p>On a pilgrimage don’t be third man: 3 oxen can’t draw a plough.</p>
<p>Don’t drink all that’s in a cup offered you; take a little.</p>
<p>If you sleep with any man, ask what part of the bed he likes, and lie
far from him.</p>
<p>If you journey with any man, find out his name, who he is, where he
is going.</p>
<p>With friars on a pilgrimage, do as they do.</p>
<p>Don’t put up at a red (haired and faced) man or woman’s house.</p>
<p>Answer opponents meekly, but don’t tell lies.</p>
<p>Before your lord at table, keep your hands, feet, and fingers
still.</p>
<p>Don’t stare about, or at the wall, or lean against the post.</p>
<p>Don’t pick your nose, scratch your arm, or stoop your head.</p>
<p>Listen when you’re spoken to.</p>
<p>Never harm child or beast with evil eye (?) Don’t blush when you’re
chaffed, or you’ll be accused of mischief.</p>
<p>Don’t make faces.</p>
<p>Wash before eating.</p>
<p>Sit where the host tells you; avoid the highest place unless you’re
told to take it.</p>

Hall.</i></p>

of the Hall.</p>
<p>Fires last from Allsaints’ Day to Candlemas Eve, (Nov. 1 to Feb. 2.)

<p>2. Yeoman-usher,</p>
<p>3. Two grooms and a Page.</p>

<p>He puts 3 wax-lights over the chimney, all in different syces.</p>

<p><i>The Usher of the Chamber</i> walks about and sees that all is
served right, orders the table to be set and removed, takes charge of
the Wardrobe and Bedchamber, bids the <i>Wardroper</i> get all ready
before the fire, nightgown, carpet, 2 cushions, a form with a footsheet
over it; on which the lord changes his gown.</p>
<p>The Usher orders what’s wanted from the Buttery: a link from the
Chandler, and ale and wine.</p>
<p>(No meat shall be assayed except for King, Prince, Duke or
Heirs-apparent.)</p>
<p>From the Pantry the Usher takes fine and coarse bread, and a
wax-light that burns all night in a basin.</p>
<p>(The Yeoman-Usher removes the torches.)</p>
<p>The Usher puts lights on the Bedroom door, brings bread and wine,
(the lord washing first,) offers the drink kneeling; puts his lord to
bed, and then goes home himself.</p>
<p>The Yeoman-Usher sleeps at the Lord’s door.</p>

<h5>Of the Steward.</h5>
<p>Few are true, but many false.</p>
<p>He, the clerk, cook and surveyor consult over their Lord’s
dinner.</p>
<p>Any dainty that can be had, the Steward buys.</p>
<p>Before dishes are put on, the Steward enters first, then the
Server.</p>
<p>The Steward shall post into books all accounts written on tablets,
and add them up.</p>

<h5>Of the Controller.</h5>
<p>He puts down the receipt and consumption of every day.</p>

<h5>Of the Surveyor.</h5>
<p>He, the steward, and controller, receive nothing, but see that all
goes straight.</p>
<p>The Controller checks daily the Clerk of the kitchen’s account.</p>

<h5>Of the Clerk of the Kitchen.</h5>
<p>He shall keep account of all purchases, and payments, and wages,

<p>He oversees the land too, and is a great man.</p>

<h5>Of the Treasurer.</h5>
<p>He takes from the Receiver what is collected from bailiff and grieve,
courts and forfeits.</p>
<p>He gives the Kitchen clerk money to buy provisions with, and the
clerk gives some to the baker and butler.</p>
<p>The Treasurer pays all wages.</p>
<p>He, the Receiver, Chancellor, Grieves, &amp;c., account once a year
to the Auditor, from whom they can appeal to a Baron of the
Exchequer.</p>

<h5>Of the Receiver of Rents.</h5>
<p>He gives receipts, and gets a fee of 6d.</p>
<p>He pays fees to park-keepers, and looks after castles and
manor-houses.</p>

<h5>Of the Avener.</h5>
<p>He shall give the horses in the stable two armsful of hay and a peck
of oats, daily.</p>
<p>A Squire is Master of the Horse; under him are Avener and Farrier,
(the Farrier has a halfpenny a day for every horse he shoes,) and grooms
and pages hired at 2d. a day, or 3 halfpence, and footmen who run by
ladies’ bridles.</p>

<h5>Of the Baker.</h5>
<p>Out of a London bushel he shall bake 20 loaves, fine and coarse.</p>

<h5>Of the Huntsman and his Hounds.</h5>
<p>He gets a halfpenny a day for every hound.</p>
<p>The Feuterer 2 lots of bread if he has 2 leash of Greyhounds, and a
bone for each, besides perquisites of skins, &amp;c.</p>

<h5>Of the Ewerer or Water-bringer.</h5>
<p>He has all the candles and cloths and gives water to every one.</p>

<h5>Who may wash his hands, and where.</h5>
<p>The bringer of Water shall kneel down.</p>
<p>The Ewerer shall cover the lord’s table with a double cloth, the
lower with the selvage to the lord’s side; the upper cloth shall be laid
double, the upper selvage turned back as if for a towel.</p>
<p>He shall put on cleaners for every one.</p>

<h5>Of the Panter.</h5>
<p>He carries 3 loaves cut square for trenchers, and the covered
Saltcellar, 2 Carving-knives, and sets the 3rd, and a spoon to his
lord.</p>

<h5>Of the Lord’s Knives, (Bread, and Washing.)</h5>
<p>The hafts of 2 are laid outwards, that of the 3rd inwards, and the
spoon handle by it.</p>
<p>More trencher loaves are set, and wine served to the Duchess.</p>
<p>2 Trencher-loaves, and salt, to the lord’s son; and 1 loaf and
saltcellar set at the end of the table.</p>
<p>Then 3 loaves of white bread are brought, and 1 coarse loaf is put in
the Alms-dish.</p>
<p>To assay bread, the Panter kneels, the Carver cuts him a slice, and
he eats it.</p>
<p>The Ewerer strains water into his basins, on the upper one of which
is a towel folded dodgily.</p>
<p>Then the water is assayed in a cup of white wood.</p>
<p>The Carver takes up the basins; a knight takes down the towel, and
wipes the cup, into which the Carver pours water; the knight hands it to
him;
he assays it, and empties the cup.</p>
<p>Two knights hold the towel before the lord’s sleeves, and hold the
upper basin while the Carver pours water into the lower; then he puts
the lower into the upper, and empties both, takes them to the Ewerer,
returns to the lord’s table, lays 4 trenchers for him, with 1 above.</p>
<p>The Carver takes 3 to cut the lord’s messes on, and has a cloth round
his neck to wipe his knives on.</p>

<h5>Of the Almoner.</h5>
<p>He says grace, sets down the Alms-dish, and the Carver puts the first
loaf in it.</p>
<p>The other loaves he pares round, cuts one in two, and gives the upper
half in halves to him.</p>
<p>The Almoner has a staff in his hand.</p>
<p>He keeps the broken food and wine left, for poor men at the gate, and
is sworn to give it all to them.</p>
<p>He distributes silver as he rides.</p>

<h5>Of the Sewer (or setter-on of Dishes).</h5>
<p>The Cook assays the meat before it’s dished.</p>
<p>The Sewer puts the cover on it, and the cover must never be raised
for fear of treason.</p>
<p>(A Dodge: If the silver dish burns you, put bits of bread under
it.)</p>
<p>The Sewer assays all the food: potage with a piece of bread; fish or
flesh, he eats a piece; baked meats hot, he lifts up the crust, and dips
bread in the gravy; baked meats cold, he eats a bit.</p>
<p>The meat-bearer stands or kneels as the Sewer does.</p>
<p>When bread is wanted, the Butler puts one loaf on the table, the
other on the cupboard.</p>
<p>The Butler assays all the wine.</p>
<p>What is left in the lord’s cup goes to the Alms-dish.</p>
<p>The Carver fills the empty cup, assays it, and gives it the lord or
puts it down.</p>
<p>He carves the lord’s meat, and lays it on his trencher, putting a
piece of every thing in the Alms-dish, except any favourite piece or
potage sent to a stranger.</p>
<p>(To say more about the Carver would require another section, so I
pass it over.)</p>
<p>After dinner the Sewer brings the Surnape, a broad towel and a
narrow, and slides it down.</p>
<p>The Usher takes one end of the broad one, the Almoner the other, and
when it is laid, he folds the narrow towel double before his lord and
lady.</p>
<p>After grace removes them, lays the table on the floor, and takes away
the trestles.</p>

<h5>Of the Chandler.</h5>
<p>He can make all kinds of candles, little and big, and mortars of
wax.</p>
<p>He snuffs them with short scissors.</p>
<p>In bed-chambers wax lights only shall be burnt; in hall, Candles of
Paris, each mess having one from Nov. 1 to Feb. 2 (see l. 393), and
squires one too.</p>
<p>The Butler shall give Squires their daily bread and ale all the year,

<p>Repeat the Lord’s Prayer night and morning.</p>

<h5>How to wash and dress yourself.</h5>
<p>Don’t sleep too long.</p>
<p>Rise early; cast up your bed, and don’t let it lie.</p>
<p>Go down, salute your parents, wash your hands, comb your head, brush
your cap and put it on.</p>
<p>Tie on your shirt-collar, fasten your girdle, rub your breeches,
clean your shoes, wipe your nose on a napkin, pare your nails, clean
your ears, wash your teeth.</p>
<p>Have your torn clothes mended, or new ones obtained.</p>
<p>Get your satchell and books, and haste to School, taking too pen,
paper, and ink, which are necessary for use at school.</p>
<p>Then start off.</p>

<h5>How to behave going to, and at, School.</h5>
<p>Take off your cap to those you meet; give way to passers by.</p>
<p>Call your playmates on your road.</p>
<p>At School salute your master, and the scholars.</p>
<p>Go straight to your place, undo your satchell, take out your books
and learn your lesson; stick well to your books.</p>
<p>If you don’t work, you’ll repent it when you grow up.</p>
<p>Who could now speak of famous deeds of old, had not Letters preserved
them?</p>
<p>Work hard then, and you’ll be thought worthy to serve the state.</p>
<p>Men of low birth win honour by Learning, and then are doubly
happy.</p>
<p>When you doubt, ask to be told.</p>
<p>Wish well to those who warn you.</p>
<p>On your way home walk two and two orderly (for which men will praise
you); don’t run in heaps like a swarm of bees like boys do now.</p>
<p>Don’t whoop or hallow as in fox-hunting don’t chatter, or stare at
every new fangle, but walk soberly, taking your cap off to all, and
being gentle.</p>
<p>Do no man harm; speak fair words.</p>
<p>On reaching home salute your parents reverently.</p>

<h5>How to wait at table.</h5>
<p>Look your parents in the face, hold up your hands, and say Grace
before meate.</p>
<p>Grace before Meat.</p>
<p>Make a low curtesy; wish your parents’ food may do ’em good.</p>
<p>If you are big enough, bring the food to table.</p>
<p>Don’t fill dishes so full as to spill them on your parents’ dress, or
they’ll be angry.</p>
<p>Have spare trenchers ready for guests.</p>
<p>See there’s plenty of everything wanted.</p>
<p>Empty the Voiders often.</p>
<p>Be at hand if any one calls.</p>
<p>When the meat is over, clear the table:</p>
<div class = "inset">
<p>1. cover the salt,</p>
<p>2. have a tray by you to carry things off on,</p>
<p>3. put the trenchers, &amp;c., in one Voider,</p>
<p>4. sweep the crumbs into another,</p>
<p>5. set a clean trencher before every one,</p>
<p>6. put on Cheese, Fruit, Biscuits, and</p>
<p>7. serve Wine, Ale or Beer.</p>
</div>
<p>When these are finished, clear the table, and fold up the cloth.</p>
<p>Then spread a clean towel, bring bason and jug, and when your parents
are ready to wash, and when your parents are ready to wash, pour out the
water.</p>
<p>Clear the table; make a low curtsey.</p>

<h5>How to behave at your own dinner.</h5>
<p>Let your betters sit above you.</p>
<p>See others served first, then wait a while before eating.</p>
<p>Take salt with your knife, cut your bread, don’t fill your spoon too
full, or sup your pottage.</p>
<p>Have your knife sharp.</p>
<p>Don’t smack your lips or gnaw your bones: avoid such beastliness.</p>
<p>Keep your fingers clean, wipe your mouth before drinking.</p>
<p>Don’t jabber or stuff.</p>
<p>Silence hurts no one, and is fitted for a child at table.</p>
<p>Don’t pick your teeth, or spit too much.</p>
<p>Behave properly.</p>
<p>Don’t laugh too much.</p>
<p>Learn all the good manners you can.</p>
<p>They are better than playing the fiddle, though that’s no harm, but
necessary; yet manners are more important.</p>

<h5>How to behave at Church.</h5>
<p>Pray kneeling or standing.</p>
<p>Confess your sins to God.</p>
<p>He knows your disease.</p>
<p>Ask in faith, and what you ask you shall have; He is more merciful
than pen can tell.</p>
<p>Behave nicely in church, and don’t talk or chatter.</p>
<p>Behave reverently; the House of Prayer is not to be made a fair.</p>
<p>Avoid dicing and carding.</p>
<p>Delight in Knowledge, Virtue, and Learning.</p>
<p>Happy is he who cultivates Virtue.</p>
<p>Cursed is he who forsakes it.</p>
<p>Let reason rule you, and subdue your lusts.</p>
<p>These ills come from gambling: strife, murder, theft, cursing and
swearing.</p>

<h5>How to behave when conversing.</h5>
<p>Understand a question before you answer it; let a man tell all his
tale.</p>
<p>Then bow to him, look him in the face, and answer sensibly, not
staring about or laughing, but audibly and distinctly, your words in due
order, or you’ll straggle off, or stutter, or stammer, which is a foul
crime.</p>
<p>Always keep your head uncovered.</p>
<p>Better unfed than untaught.</p>

<h5>How to take a Message.</h5>
<p>Listen to it well; don’t go away not knowing it.</p>
<p>Then hurry away, give the message; get the answer, return home, and
tell it to your master exactly as it was told to you.</p>

<h5>Against Anger, &amp;c.</h5>
<p>The slave of Anger must fall.</p>
<p>Anger’s deeds are strange to wise men.</p>
<p>A hasty man is always in trouble.</p>
<p>Take no revenge, but forgive.</p>
<p>Envy no one.</p>
<p>An ill body breeds debate.</p>

<h5>The Fruits of Charity, &amp;c.</h5>
<p>Charity seeketh not her own, but bears patiently.</p>
<p>Charity seeketh not her own, but bears patiently.</p>
<p>Love incites to Mercy.</p>
<p>Patience teaches forbearance.</p>
<p>Pray God to give thee Charity and Patience, to lead thee to Virtue’s
School, and thence to Eternal Bliss.</p>

<h5>Against Swearing.</h5>
<p>Take not God’s name in vain, or He will plague thee.</p>
<p>Beware of His wrath, and live well in thy vocation.</p>
<p>What is the good of swearing?</p>
<p>It kindles God’s wrath against thee.</p>
<p>God’s law forbids swearing, and so does the counsel of
Philosophers.</p>

<h5>Against filthy talking.</h5>
<p>Never talk dirt.</p>
<p>For every word we shall give account at the Day of Doom, and be
judged according to our deeds.</p>
<p>Let lewd livers then fear.</p>
<p>Keep your tongue from vain talking.</p>

<h5>Against Lying.</h5>
<p>To speak the truth needs no study, therefore always practise it and
speak it.</p>
<p>Shame is the reward of lying.</p>
<p>Always speak the truth.</p>
<p>Who can trust a liar?</p>
<p>If a lie saves you once, it deceives you thrice.</p>

<h5>A bedward Prayer.</h5>
<p>God of mercy, take us into Thy care.</p>
<p>Forgive us our sins.</p>
<p>Deliver us from evil, and our enemy the Devil.</p>
<p>Assist us to conquer him and ascribe all honour to Thee.</p>

<h5>Each one’s Duty.</h5>
<p>The Duty of Princes, Judges, Prelates, Parents, Children, Masters,
Servants, Husbands.</p>
<p>The Duty of Wives, Parsons and Vicars, Men of Law, Craftsmen,
Landlords, Merchants, Subjects, Rich Men, Poor Men, Magistrates,
Officers, The Duty of all Men.</p>
<p>God grant us all to live and die well!</p>

<p>A man must mind what he says; hearts are fickle and fell.</p>
<p>Take care what you say. A false friend may hear it, and after a year
or two will repeat it.</p>
<p>Hasty speech hurts hearer and speaker. In the beginning, think on the

<p>You tell a man a secret, and he’ll betray it for a drink of wine.
Mind what you say.</p>

The Babees Book</a></h4>

<p>My God, support me while I translate this treatise from Latin. It
shall teach those of tender age.</p>
<p>To know and practise virtues is the most profitable thing in the
world.</p>
<p>Young Babies, adorned with grace, I call on you to know this book
(for Nurture should accompany beauty), and not on aged men expert
therein.</p>
<p>Why add pain to hell, water to the sea, or heat to fire?</p>
<p>Babies, my book is for you only, and so I hope no one will find fault
with it, but only amend it.</p>
<p>The only reward I seek is that my book may please all and improve
you.</p>
<p>If you don’t know any word in it, ask till you do, and then keep hold
of it.</p>
<p>And do not wonder at this being in metre.</p>
<p>I must first describe how you Babies who dwell in households should
behave at meals, and be ready with lovely and benign words when you are
spoken to.</p>
<p>Lady Facetia, help me! Thou art the Mother of all Virtue.</p>
<p>Help the ignorance of me untaught!</p>
<p>Fair Babies, when you enter your lord’s place, say “God speed,” and
salute all there.</p>
<p>Kneel on one knee to your lord.</p>
<p>If any speak to you, look straight at them, and listen well till they
have finished; do not chatter or let your eyes wander about the
house.</p>
<p>Answer sensibly, shortly, and easily.</p>
<p>Many words are a bore to a wise man.</p>
<p>Stand till you are told to sit: keep your head, hands, and feet
quiet:
don’t scratch yourself, or lean against a post, or handle anything
near.</p>
<p>Bow to your lord when you answer.</p>
<p>If any one better than yourself comes in, retire and give place to
him.</p>
<p>Turn your back on no man.</p>
<p>Be silent while your lord drinks, not laughing, whispering, or
joking.</p>
<p>If he tells you to sit down, do so at once.</p>
<p>Then don’t talk dirt, or scorn any one, but be meek and cheerful.</p>
<p>If your better praises you, rise up and thank him heartily.</p>
<p>When your lord or lady is speaking about the household, don’t you
interfere, but be always ready to serve at the proper time, to bring
drink, hold lights, or anything else, and so get a good name.</p>
<p>The best prayer you can make to God is to be well mannered.</p>
<p>If your lord offers you his cup, rise up, take it with both hands,
offer it to no one else, but give it back to him that brought it.</p>
<p>At Noon, when your lord is ready for dinner, some pour water on him,
some hold the towel for him till he has finished, and don’t leave till
grace is said.</p>
<p>Stand by your lord till he tells you to sit, then keep your knife
clean and sharp to cut your food.</p>
<p>Be silent, and tell no nasty stories.</p>
<p>Cut your bread, don’t break it.</p>
<p>Lay a clean trencher before you, and eat your broth with a spoon,
don’t sup it up.</p>
<p>Don’t leave your spoon in your dish.</p>
<p>Don’t lean on the table, or dirty the cloth.</p>
<p>Don’t hang your head over your dish, or eat with a full mouth, or
pick your nose, teeth, and nails, or stuff your mouth so that you can’t
speak.</p>
<p>Wipe your mouth when you drink, and don’t dirty the cup with your
hands.</p>
<p>Don’t dip your meat in the salt-cellar, or put your knife in your
mouth.</p>
<p>Taste every dish that’s brought to you, and when once your plate is
taken away, don’t ask for it again.</p>
<p>If strangers dine with you, share all good food sent to you with
them.</p>
<p>It’s not polite to keep it all to yourself.</p>
<p>Don’t cut your meat like field labourers, who have such an appetite
they don’t care how they hack their food.</p>
<p>Sweet children, let your delight be courtesy, and eschew
rudeness.</p>
<p>Have a clean trencher and knife for your cheese, and eat
properly.</p>
<p>Don’t chatter either, and you shall get a good repute for
gentleness.</p>
<p>When the meal is over, clean your knives, and put them in their
places; keep your seats till you’ve washed; then rise up without
laughing or joking, and go to your lord’s table.</p>
<p>Stand there till grace is said.</p>
<p>Then some of you go for water, some hold the towel, some pour water
over his hands.</p>
<p>Other things I shall not put in this little Report, but skip over,
praying that no one will abuse me for this work.</p>
<p>Let readers add or take away: I address it to every one who likes to
correct it.</p>
<p>Sweet children, I beseech you know this book, and may God make you so
expert therein that you may attain endless bliss.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
