<p>Of the wine drunk in England in Elizabeth’s time, Harrison
(Holinshed’s Chron. v.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;167, col. 2, ed. 1586) says, “As
all estates doo exceed herin, I&nbsp;meane for strangenesse and number
of costlie dishes, so these forget not to vse the like excesse in wine,
in so much as there is no kind to be had (neither anie where more store
of all sorts than in England, although we have none growing with us, but
yearlie to the proportion of 20,000 or 30,000 tun and vpwards,
notwithstanding the dailie restreincts of the same brought over vnto vs)
wherof at great meetings there is not some store to be had. Neither do I
meane this of small wines onlie, as <i>Claret</i>, White, Red, French,

&amp;c., which amount to about fiftie-six sorts, according to the number
of regions from whence they come: but also of the thirtie kinds of
Italian, Grecian, Spanish, Canarian, &amp;c., whereof <i>Vernage</i>,
<i>Cate</i>, <i>pument</i>, <i>Raspis</i>, <i>Muscadell</i>,
<i>Romnie</i>, <i>Bastard</i>, <i>Tire</i>, <i>Oseie</i>,
<i>Caprike</i>, <i>Clareie</i>, and <i>Malmesie</i>, are not least of
all accompted of, bicause of their strength and valure. For as I haue
said in meat, so the stronger the wine is, the more it is desired, by
means wherof in old time, the best was called <i>Theologicum</i>,
because it was had from the cleargie and religious men, vnto whose
houses manie of the laitie would often send for bottels filled with the
same, being sure that they would neither drinke nor be serued of the
worst, or such as was anie waies mingled or brued by the vintener: naie
the merchant would haue thought that his soul<i>e</i> should haue gone
streight-waie to the diuell, if he should haue serued them with other
than the best.”</p>

<i>Vernage</i> was a red wine, of a bright colour, and a sweetish and
somewhat rough flavour, which was grown in Tuscany and other parts of
Italy, and derived its name from the thick-skinned grape,
<i>vernaccia</i> (corresponding with the <i>vinaciola</i> of the
ancients), that was used in the preparation of it (See Bacci. Nat.
Vinor. Hist., p.&nbsp;20, 62). It is highly praised by Redi.*</p>

made thereof hath a speciall power and virtue against the Hæmorrhois
alone, of all other serpents,” p.&nbsp;148. “Of new pressed wine is made
the wine called <i>Cute</i>, in Latin, <i>Sapa</i>; and it is by boiling
the new pressed wine so long, as till that there remaine but one of
three parts. Of new pressed wine is also made another <i>Cute</i>,
called of the Latines <i>Defrutum</i>, and this is by boiling of the new
wine onely so long, as till the halfe part be consumed, and the rest
become of the thicknesse of honey.” <i>Maison Rustique</i>, p.&nbsp;622.

<i>Pyment.</i> In order to cover the harshness and acidity common to the
greater part of the wines of this period, and to give them an agreeable
flavour, it was not unusual to mix honey and spices with them. Thus
compounded they passed under the generic name of <i>piments</i>,†
probably because they were

Act&nbsp;5 Richard&nbsp;II. (St.&nbsp;1, c.&nbsp;4, <i>vin doulce, ou

seasoned in much the same way, as may be inferred from an order of the
36th of Henry III. respecting the delivery of two casks of white wine
and one of red, to make <i>Clarry</i> and other liquors for the king’s

because they are oftentimes adulterated and falsified with honey, as we
see wine Hydromell to be prepared) and Corsick wines, so much vsed of
the Romanes, are very pernicious unto vs, if we vse them as our common
drinke. Notwithstanding, we proue them very singular good in cold
diseases ... but chiefly and principally Malmesey.” Stevens and

<i>Rompney.</i> Henderson, p. 288, says, “Another of the above-mentioned
wines (in <i>the Squire of Low Degree</i>) designated by the name of the
grape, was the Romenay, otherwise Romenay, Rumney, Romaine, or Romagnia.
That it could not be the produce of the Ecclesiastical State, as the two
last corruptions of the word would seem to imply, may be safely averred;
for at no period, since the decline of the empire, has the Roman soil
furnished any wines for exportation; and even Bacci, with all his
partiality, is obliged to found his eulogy of them on their ancient
fame, and to confess that, in his time, they had fallen into disrepute.”
He argues also against the notion that this wine came from Romana in
Aragon, and concludes that it was probably a Greek wine, as Bacci
(<i>Nat. Vin. Hist.</i> p.&nbsp;333) tells us that the wine from the
Ioinan Islands and adjoining continent was called in Italian
<i>Romania</i>,&mdash;from the Saracen <i>Rum-ili</i>. Now this is all
very well, but how about the name of <i>Rompney of Modene</i> or Modena,
just outside the Western boundary of the Romagna,&mdash;not Meudon, in
France, “amongst all the wines which we use at Paris, as concerning the
red, the best are those of Coussy, Seure, Vaunes, and <i>Meudon</i>.”

<i>Bastard.</i> Henderson argues against the above-quoted (No.&nbsp;6)
supposition of Charles Etienne’s (which is supported by Cotgrave’s
<i>Vin miellé</i>, honied wine, <i>bastard</i>, Metheglin, sweet wine),
and adopts Venner’s account (<i>Via Recta ad Vitam Longam</i>), that
“Bastard is in virtue somewhat like to muskadell, and may also in stead
thereof be used; it is in goodness so much inferiour to muskadell, as
the same is to malmsey.” It took its name, Henderson thinks, from the
grape of which it was made, probably a bastard species of muscadine.
“One of the varieties of vines now cultivated in the Alto Douro, and
also in Madeira, is called <i>bastardo</i>, and the must which it yields
is of a sweetish quality<ins class = "mycorr" title = "close quote conjectural">.” </ins>Of the Bastard wine there were two
sorts,&mdash;white and brown (brown and white bastard, <i>Measure for
Measure</i>, Act iii. sc.&nbsp;2), both of them, according to Markham’s
report, “fat and strong; the tawny or brown kind being the sweetest.” In
<i>The Libelle of Englysch Polycye</i>, <span class =

<i>Ozey.</i> Though this is placed among the “commodities of Portugal”
in some verses inserted in the first volume of Hackluyt’s Voyages,
p.&nbsp;188&mdash;Her land hath wine, <i>osey</i>, waxe, and
grain,&mdash;yet, says Henderson, “a&nbsp;passage in Valois’ Description
of France, p.&nbsp;12, seems to prove, beyond dispute, that <i>oseye</i>
was an Alsatian wine; <i>Auxois</i> or <i>Osay</i> being, in old times,
the name constantly used for Alsace. If this conjecture is well-founded,
we may presume that <i>oseye</i> was a luscious-sweet, or straw-wine,
similar to that which is still made in that province. That it was a
rich, high-flavoured liquor is sufficiently shown by a receipt for
imitating it, which may be seen in Markham (<i>English Housewife</i>,
1683, p, 115), and we learn from Bacci p.&nbsp;350) that the wines which
Alsace then furnished in great profusion to England as well as different
parts of the continent, were of that description. In the ‘Bataille des
Vins’ we find the ‘Vin d’<i>Aussai</i>’ associated with the growths of
the Moselle.” <i>Osey</i> is one ‘Of the commoditees of Portingalle,’

grew, like the wady of Eschcol or of Sorek; but I don’t remember any

<i>Greke Malevesyñ.</i> “The best dessert wines were made from the
Malvasia grape; and Candia, where it was chiefly cultivated, for a long
time retained the monopoly,” says Henderson. He quotes Martin Leake to
explain the name. Monemvasia is a small fortified town in the bay of
Epidaurus Limera. “It was anciently a promontory called Minoa, but is
now an island connected with the coast of Laconia by a bridge. The name

<i>Ale.</i> See the praise of the unparalleled liquor called Ale,

smoky, nor it muste haue no werte nor tayle. Ale shulde not be dronke
under .v.&nbsp;dayes olde. Newe Ale is vnholsome for all men. And sowre
ale, and dead ale, and ale the whiche doth stande a tylte, is good for
no man. Barly malte maketh better Ale than Oten malte or any other corne
doth: it doth ingendre grose humours: but it maketh a man stronge.</p>

<p>Beere is made of malte, of hoppes, and water. It is a naturall drynke
for a doche man. And nowe of late dayes [1557 ?] it is moche vsed in
England to the detryment of many Englysshe men; specyally it kylleth
them the whiche be troubled with the Colycke and the stone, and the

sneeze, if you can avoid it; and as to hawking and spitting, the name of
such a thing is enough to forbid it, without a command. When you are

not put your hands on the back of the chair, as it is very improper;
though I have seen some not only do so, but even beat a kind of tune
upon it with their fingers. Instead of this, stand upright with your
hands hanging down or before you, but not folded. Let your demeanour be
such as becomes the situation which you are in. Be well dressed, and
have light shoes that make no noise, your face and hands well washed,
your finger-nails cut short and kept quite clean underneath; have a
nail-brush for that purpose, as it is a disgusting thing to see black
dirt under the nails. Let the lapels of your coat be buttoned, as they
will only be flying in your way.” 1825. T. Cosnett. Footman’s Directory,
p.&nbsp;97-8. Lord A. Percy’s Waiters were changed every quarter. See
the lists of them in the <i>Percy Household Book</i>, p.&nbsp;53-4.</p>

Forks were not introduced into England till Coryat’s time. See his
<i>Crudities</i> p.&nbsp;90-1, 4to. London, 1611, on the strange use of
the Fork in Italy. “I&nbsp;observ’d a custom in all those Italian Cities
and Townes through the which I passed, that is not used in any other
country that I saw in my travels, neither do I thinke that any other
nation of Christendome doth use it, but only Italy. The Italian and also
most Strangers that are comorant in Italy, doe always at their meals use
a <i>Little Forke</i> when they cut their meat.” Percy’s notes,

the breeding season, the Bittern makes a loud booming or bellowing
noise, whence, probably, the generic term <i>Botaurus</i> was selected
for it; but when roused at other times, the bird makes a sharp, harsh
cry on rising, not unlike that of a Wild Goose. <i>Yarrell</i>, ii. 573.
The Bittern was formerly in some estimation as an article of food for
the table; the flesh is said to resemble that of the Leveret in colour
and taste, with some of the flavour of wild fowl. Sir Thomas Browne says
that young Bitterns were considered a better dish than young Herons ...

means pickled, ‘As Porpesses must be baked while they are new, so Tunny
is never good till it have been long <i>pouldred</i> with salt, vinegar,
coriander, and hot spices.’ In p.&nbsp;154 it may be either salt or
pickled; ‘Horne-beaks are ever lean (as some think) because they are
ever fighting; yet are they good and tender, whether they be eaten fresh
or <i>poudred</i>.’ <i>Powdered</i>, says Nicolas, meant sprinkled over,
and “powdered beef” i.e. beef sprinkled with salt, is still in use.

assigneth them rather to be eaten in Winter time, because the concoctive
powers are more stronger through plenty of inward heat; but withal
admonisheth, that no man use to eat much of them, for it will breed
Palsies and trembling in mans body, begetting grosse humors, which stop

Does the word mean ‘foster-mothers or fathers,’ from the Latin

<i>Hæcque consuetudo erat, ut quando aliquis homo de ipsis infantibus

<i>Pouldre blanche</i>. A powder compounded of Ginger, Cinnamon, and
Nutmegs; much in use among Cookes. Cotgrave. Is there any authority for
the statement in <i>Domestic Architecture</i>, v.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;132;
that sugar ‘was sometimes called <i>blanch powdre</i>’?
P.S.&mdash;Probably the recollection of what Pegge says in the Preface
to the <i>Forme of Cury</i>, “There is mention of <i>blanch-powder or
white sugar</i>,” 132 [p.&nbsp;63]. They, however, were not the same,
for see No. 193, p.&nbsp;xxvi-xxvii. On turning to the Recipe 132, of
“Peer<i>is</i> in confyt,” p.&nbsp;62-3, we find “whan þei [the pears]

Muffett held a very different opinion. ‘Old and dry cheese hurteth
dangerously: for it stayeth siege [stools], stoppeth the Liver,
engendereth choler, melancholy, and the stone, lieth long in the stomack
undigested, procureth thirst, maketh a stinking breath and a scurvy
skin: Whereupon Galen and Isaac have well noted, That as we may feed
liberally of ruin cheese, and more liberally of fresh Cheese, so we are
not to taste any further of old and hard Cheese, then to close up the
mouth of our stomacks after meat,’ p.&nbsp;131.</p>

for old men when they are declining; but very unwholesom betwixt those

Short coats and tight trousers were a great offence to old writers
accustomed to long nightgown clothes. Compare Chaucer’s complaint in the
Canterbury Tales, The Parsones Tale, <i>De Superbiâ</i>, p.&nbsp;193,
col. 2, ed. Wright. “Upon that other syde, to speke of the horrible
disordinat scantnes of clothing, as ben these cuttid sloppis or anslets,
that thurgh her schortnes ne covereth not the schamful membre of man, to
wickid entent. Alas! som men of hem schewen the schap and the boce of
the horrible swollen membres, that semeth like to the maladies of
hirnia, in the wrapping of here hose, and eek the buttokes of hem, that
faren as it were the hinder part of a sche ape in the fulle of the
moone.” The continuation of the passage is very curious. “Youre schort
gownys thriftlesse” are also noted in the song in Harl. MS. 372. See

The Brewe is mentioned three times, and each time in connection with the

or Half Curlew. I&nbsp;have a recollection (or what seems like it) of
having seen the name with a French form like Whimbreau. [Pennant’s
British Zoology, ii. 347, gives <i>Le petit Courly, ou le Courlieu</i>,
as the French synonym of the Whimbrel.] Morris (Orpen) says the numbers
of the Whimbrel are lessening from their being sought as food.

“The singular structure of the windpipe and its convolutions lodged
between the two plates of bone forming the sides of the keel of the
sternum of this bird (the Crane) have long been known. The trachea or
windpipe, quitting the neck of the bird, passes downwards and backwards
between the branches of the merry-thought towards the inferior edge of
the keel, which is hollowed out to receive it. Into this groove the
trachea passes, ... and after making three turns passes again forwards
and upwards and ultimately backwards to be attached to the two lobes of
the lungs.” Yarrell, <i>Brit. Birds</i> ii. 441. Atkinson.</p>

? <i>buche de bois.</i> A logge, backe stocke, or great billet. Cot.
I&nbsp;suppose the <i>buche</i> to refer to the manner of
<i>checkering</i> the custard, buche-wise, and not to be a dish. Venison
is ‘chekkid,’ l.&nbsp;388-9. This rendering is confirmed by <i>The Boke
of Keruynge’s</i> “Custarde, cheke them inch square” (in Keruynge of
Flesshe). Another possible rendering of <i>buche</i> as a dish of batter
or the like, seems probable from the ‘Bouce Jane, a&nbsp;dish in Ancient
Cookery’ (Wright’s Prov<sup>l</sup>.&nbsp;Dict<sup>y</sup>.), but the
recipe for it in Household Ordinances, p.&nbsp;431, shows that it was a
stew, which could not be checkered or squared. It consisted of milk
boiled with chopped herbs, half-roasted chickens or capons cut into
pieces, ‘pynes and raysynges of corance,’ all boiled together. In
<i>Household Ordinances</i>, p.&nbsp;162-4, <i>Bouche</i>, or <i>Bouche
of court</i>, is used for allowance. The ‘Knights and others of the
King’s Councell,’ &amp;c., had each

killeth worms, and purgeth the matter whereof they be engendred.
Wherefore it is much vsed among vs in England, about Easter, with fried
Egs, not without good cause, to purge away the fleume engendred of fish
in Lent season, whereof worms are soone bred in them that be thereto
disposed.” Tansey, says Bailey (<i>Dict. Domesticum</i>) is recommended
for the dissipating of wind in the stomach and belly. He gives the
recipe for ‘A Tansy’ made of spinage, milk, cream, eggs, grated bread
and nutmeg, heated till it’s as thick as a hasty pudding, and then
baked.</p>

Topsell in his <i>Fourfooted Beasts</i>, ed. Rowland, 1658, p.&nbsp;36,
says of Beavers, “There hath been taken of them whose tails have weighed
four pound weight, and they are accounted a very delicate dish, for
being dressed they eat like Barbles: they are used by the Lotharingians
and Savoyans [says Bellonius] for meat allowed to be eaten on
fish-dayes, although the body that beareth them be flesh and unclean for
food. The manner of their dressing is, first roasting, and afterward
seething in an open pot, that so the evill vapour may go away, and some
in pottage made with Saffron; other with Ginger, and many with Brine; it
is certain that the tail and forefeet taste very sweet, from whence came
the Proverbe, <i>That sweet is that fish, which is not fish at
all</i>.”</p>

<i>Pintle</i> generally means the penis; but Dr Günther says the whelk
has no visible organs of generation, though it has a projecting tube by
which it takes in water, and the function of this might have been
misunderstood. Dr&nbsp;G. could suggest nothing for <i>almond</i>, but
on looking at the drawing of the male Whelk (<i>Buccinum undatum</i>)
creeping, in the Penny Cyclopædia, v.&nbsp;9, p.&nbsp;454, col.&nbsp;2
(art. Entomostomata), it is quite clear that the <i>almond</i> must mean
the animal’s horny, oval <i>operculum</i> on its hinder part. ‘Most
spiral shells have an <i>operculum</i>, or lid, with which to close the
aperture when they withdraw for shelter. It is developed on a particular
lobe at the posterior part of the foot, and consists of horny layers
sometimes hardened with shelly matter.’ <i>Woodward’s Mollusca</i>,

See note at end. Mr Gillett, of the Vicarage, Runham, Filby, Norwich,
sends me these notes on the herbs for this Bathe Medicinable:
&mdash;<b>253</b> (2): “<span class = "smallcaps">Yardehok</span> =
Mallow, some species. They are all more or less mucilaginous and
emollient. If Yarde = <i>Virga</i>; then it is Marshmallow, or Malva
Sylvestris; if yarde = erde, earth; then the rotundifolia.
&mdash;<b>254</b> (3): <span class = "smallcaps">Paritory</span> is
Pellitory of the wall, <i>parietaria</i>. Wall pellitory abounds in
nitrate of potass. There are two other pellitories: ‘P. of
Spain’&mdash;this is <i>Pyrethrum</i>, which the Spanish corrupted into
<i>pelitre</i>, and we corrupted <i>pelitre</i> into pellitory. The
other, bastard-pellitory, is <i>Achillea Ptarmica</i>. &mdash;<b>255</b>
(4): <span class = "smallcaps">Brown fennelle</span> = probably
<i>Peucedanum officinale</i>, <ins class = "edcorr" title = "corrected by author from ‘Hoss’">Hog’s</ins> fennel, a&nbsp;dangerous plant;
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
certainly not <i>Anethum Graveolens</i>, which is always dill, dyle,
dile, &amp;c. &mdash;<b>259</b> (8): <span class =
"smallcaps">Rybbewort</span>, <i>Plantago lanceolata</i>, mucilaginous.
&mdash;<b>260</b> (9): <span class = "smallcaps">Heyhove</span> =
<i>Glechoma hederacea</i>, bitter and aromatic, abounding in a principle
like camphor. &mdash;<b>261</b> (10): <span class =
"smallcaps">Heyriff</span> = harif = <i>Galium Aparine</i>, and allied
species. They were formerly considered good for scorbutic diseases, when
applied externally. Lately, in France, they have been administered
internally against epilepsy. &mdash;<b>263</b> (12): <span class =
"smallcaps">Bresewort</span>; if = brisewort or bruisewort, it would be
<i>Sambucus Ebulus</i>, but this seems most unlikely. &mdash;<ins class
= "mycorr" title = "unlabeled: note 1 on next page"><b>265</b></ins>:
<span class = "smallcaps">Brokelempk</span> = brooklime. <i>Veronica
Beccabunga</i>, formerly considered as an anti-scorbutic applied
externally. It is very inert. If a person fed on it, it might do some
good, i.e. about a quarter of the good that the same quantity of
water-cress would do. &mdash;<ins class = "mycorr" title = "number added by transcriber"><b>267</b></ins>: <span class =

<p><span class = "smallcaps">A very</span> rare black-letter book,
without date, and hitherto undescribed, except perhaps incorrectly by
Ames (vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;412, and vol.&nbsp;3, p.&nbsp;1531), has been
lent to me by Mr Algernon Swinburne. Its title is given above: “The
noble lyfe and natures of man” is in large red letters, and the rest in
smaller black ones, all surrounded by woodcuts of the wonderful animals,
mermaids, serpents, birds, quadrupeds with men’s and women’s heads,
a&nbsp;stork with its neck tied in a knot, and other beasts
“y<sup>t</sup> be most knowen.” The illustrations to each chapter are
wonderfully quaint. The author of it says in his Prologus “In the name
of ower sauiour criste Iesu, maker &amp; redemour of al ma<i>n</i>kynd /
I&nbsp;Lawre<i>n</i>s A<i>n</i>drewe of <i>th</i>e towne of Calis haue

neuer before in no maternall langage prentyd tyl now&nbsp;/” As it is
doubtful whether another copy of the book is known, I&nbsp;extract from
the Third Part of this incomplete one such notices of the fish mentioned
by Russell or Wynkyn de Worde, as it contains, with a few others for
curiosity’s sake:&mdash;</p>

Compare what Bulleyn says:&mdash; slepe. The night is the best time: the
daie is euill: to slepe in the fielde is perilous. But vpon, or in the
bedde, liyng firste vpon the right side, untill you make water: then
vpon the lefte side, is good.
<span class = "sidenote">How to lie in bed.</span>
But to lye vpon the backe, with a gaping mouth, is daungerous: and many
thereby are made starke ded in their slepe: through apoplexia, and
obstruccion of the sinewes, of the places vitalle, animall, and
nutrimentalle. <i>Bullein’s Bulwarke, The booke of the vse of sicke men
and medicenes</i>, fol. lxx. See also Sir John Harrington’s directions
from Ronsovius: “They that are in health, must first sleepe on the right
side, because the meate may come to the liuer, which is to the stomack
as a fire vnder the pot, and thereby is digested. To them which haue but
weake digestion,
<span class = "sidenote">Who should put their hands on their

it is good to sleepe prostrate on their bellies, or to haue their bare
hands on their stomackes: and to lye vpright on the backe, is to bee
vtterly abhorred.” p.&nbsp;19.</p>

how to keepe your teeth white and vncorruyt (<i>sic</i>), and also to
haue a sweete breath.
<span class = "sidenote">(How to keep the teeth sound and the breath
sweet.</span>
First, wash well your mouth when you haue eaten your meat: secondly,
sleepe with your mouth somewhat open. Thirdly, spit out in the morning
that which is gathered together that night in the throate: then take a
linnen cloth, and rub your teeth well within and without, to take away
the fumositie of the meat and the yellownesse of the teeth. For it is
that which putrifieth them and infecteth the breath. But least
peraduenture your teeth become loose and filthy,
<span class = "sidenote">Use Vaughan’s Water</span>
I&nbsp;will shew you a water farre better then pouders, which shall
fasten them, scoure the month, make sound the gums, and cause the flesh
to growe againe, if it were fallen away.
<span class = "sidenote">made after this recipe.</span>
Take halfe a glasse-full of vineger, and as much of the water of the
mastick tree (if it may easily be gotten) of rosemarie, myrrhe, mastick,
bole Armoniake, Dragons herbe, roche allome, of each of them an ounce;
of fine cinnamon halfe an ounce, and of fountaine water three
glassefulles; mingle all well together and let it boile with a small
fire, adding to it halfe a pound of honie, and taking away the scumme of
it; then put in a little bengwine, and when it hath sodden a quarter of
an houre, take it from the fire, and keepe it in a cleane bottle, and
wash your teeth therewithall as well before meate as after; if you hould
some of it in your mouth a little while, it doth much good to the head,
and sweetneth the breath.

rosewater, fennell water, or eyebright water, if you please; but I know
for certaintie, that you neede them not as long as you vse good
fountaine water. Moreouer, least you by old age or some other meanes doe
waxe dimme of sight, I&nbsp;will declare vnto you,
<span class = "sidenote">The best remedy for dim sight.</span>
the best and safest remedie which I knowe, and this it is: Take of the

For the feare of God (as it is written) is the beginning of wisedome:
and without his protection whatsoeuer you take in hand, shall fall to

<p>In the beginning of meales, eate such meates as will make the belly

not all of one qualitie: Some are easily digested, others againe are
heauy, and will lie a long time vpon the stomack: also, the eating of
sundrie sorts of meat require often pottes of

drinke, which hinder concoction; like as we see often putting of water
into the meat-potte to hinder it from seething. Our stomack is our
bodies kitchin, which being distempered, how can we liue in temperate
order: drinke not aboue foure times, and that moderately, at each meale:
least the belly-God hale you at length captiue into his prison house of
gurmandise, where you shall be afflicted with as many diseases as you
haue deuoured dishes of sundry sorts.

either of iuorie, silver, or gold. Watch not too long after supper, but
depart within two hours to bed. But if necessitie compell you to watch

your dinner and supper with the more liquid meates, sometimes with
drinkes.
<span class = "sidenote">Don’t drink between dinner and supper.</span>
In the time betweene dinner and supper, abstain altogether from cups,

<span class = "sidenote">Don’t have one fixed hour for your
meals.</span>
<p>I would not that you should obserue a certaine houre, either for
dinners or suppers, as I haue sufficiently told you before, lest that
daily custome should be altered into nature: and after this intermission
of this custome of nature, hurt may follow; for custome doth imitate
nature, and that which is accustomable, the very same thing is now
become naturall.</p>

intermit the vse of meats for a whole day together, because through
hunger, the faults of the stomacke which haue beene taken eyther by much
drinking or surfetting, or by any other meanes, may be depelled and
remoued.</p>

<p>By this meanes also your bodies shall be better accustomed to endure
