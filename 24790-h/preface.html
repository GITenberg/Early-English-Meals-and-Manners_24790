<p>The Early English Text Society was started by Dr. Furnivall in 1864
for the purpose of bringing the mass of Old English Literature within
the reach of the ordinary student, and of wiping away the reproach under
which England had long rested, of having felt little interest in the
monuments of her early language and life.</p>

<p>On the starting of the Society, so many Texts of importance were at
once taken in hand by its Editors, that it became necessary in 1867 to
open, besides the <i>Original Series</i> with which the Society began,
an <i>Extra Series</i> which should be mainly devoted to fresh editions
of all that is most valuable in printed MSS. and Caxton’s and other
black-letter books, though first editions of MSS. will not be excluded
when the convenience of issuing them demands their inclusion in the
Extra Series.</p>

<p>During the thirty-nine years of the Society’s existence, it has
produced, with whatever shortcomings, an amount of good solid work for
which all students of our Language, and some of our Literature, must be
grateful, and which has rendered possible the beginnings (at least) of
proper Histories and Dictionaries of that Language and Literature, and
has illustrated the thoughts, the life, the manners and customs of our
forefathers and foremothers.</p>

<p>But the Society’s experience has shown the very small number of those
inheritors of the speech of Cynewulf, Chaucer, and Shakspere, who care
two guineas a year for the records of that speech: ‘Let the dead past
bury its dead’ is still the cry of Great Britain and her Colonies, and
of America, in the matter of language. The Society has never had money
enough to produce the Texts that could easily have been got ready for
it; and many Editors are now anxious to send to press the work they have
prepared. The necessity has therefore arisen for trying to increase the
number of the Society’s members, and to induce its well-wishers to help
it by gifts of money, either in one sum or by instalments. The Committee
trust that every Member will bring before his or her friends and
acquaintances the Society’s claims for liberal support. Until all Early
English MSS. are printed, no proper History of our Language or Social
Life is possible.</p>

<p>The Subscription to the Society, which constitutes membership, is £1
1<i>s.</i> a year for the <span class = "smallcaps">Original
Series</span>, and £1 1<i>s.</i> for the <span class = "smallcaps">Extra
Series</span>, due in advance on the 1st of <span class =
"smallcaps">January</span>, and should be paid by Cheque, Postal Order,
or Money-Order, crost ‘Union Bank of London,’ to the Hon. Secretary,
<span class = "smallcaps">W.&nbsp;A. Dalziel</span>, Esq., 67, Victoria
Rd., Finsbury Park, London,&nbsp;N. Members who want their Texts posted
to them, must add to their prepaid Subscriptions 1<i>s.</i> for the
Original Series, and 1<i>s.</i> for the Extra Series, yearly. The
Society’s Texts are also sold separately at the prices put after them in
the Lists; but Members can get back-Texts at one-third less than the
List-prices by sending the cash for them in advance to the Hon.
Secretary.</p>

</span>The Society intends to complete, as soon as its funds will allow,
the Reprints of its out-of-print Texts of the year 1866, and also of
nos. 20, 26 and 33. Prof. Skeat has finisht <i>Partenay</i>; Dr.
M<sup>c</sup>Knight of Ohio <i>King Horn</i> and <i>Floris and
Blancheflour</i>; and Dr. Furnivall his <i>Political, Religious and Love
Poems</i> and <i>Myrc’s Duties of a Parish Priest</i>. Dr. Otto Glauning
has undertaken <i>Seinte Marherete</i>; and Dr. Furnivall has <i>Hali
Meidenhad</i> in type. As the cost of these Reprints, if they were not
needed, would have been devoted to fresh Texts, the Reprints will be
sent to all Members in lieu of such Texts. Though called ‘Reprints,’
these books are new editions, generally with valuable additions,
a&nbsp;fact not noticed by a few careless receivers of them, who have
complained that they already had the volumes. As the Society’s copies of
the <i>Facsimile of the Epinal MS.</i> issued as an Extra Volume in 1883
are exhausted, Mr. J.&nbsp;H. Hessels, M.A., of St. John’s Coll.,
Cambridge, has kindly undertaken an edition of the MS. for the Society.
This will be substituted for the Facsimile as an 1883 book, but will be
also issued to all the present Members.</p>

<p class = "headnote">
Original and Extra Series Books 1903-1906.</p>

<p><b>July 1904.</b> The Original-Series Texts for 1903 were: No. 122,
Part II of <i>The Laud MS. Troy-Book</i>, edited from the unique Laud
MS. 595 by Dr. J.&nbsp;E. Wülting; and No. 123, Part II of Robert of
Brunne’s <i>Handlyng Synne</i>, and its French original, ed. by Dr.
F.&nbsp;J. Furnivall.</p>

<p>The Extra-Series Texts for 1903 are to be: No. LXXXVIII, <i>Le Morte
Arthur</i>, in 8-line stanzas, re-edited from the unique MS. Harl. 2252,
by Prof. J.&nbsp;Douglas Bruce (issued), No. LXXXIX, Lydgate’s <i>Reason
and Sensuality</i>, edited by Dr. Ernst Sieper, Part II, and <i>English
Fragments from Latin Medieval Service-Books</i>, edited, and given to
the Society, by Mr. Henry Littlehales.</p>

<p>The Original-Series Texts for 1904 will be No. 124, t. Hen.&nbsp;V,
<i>Twenty-six Political and other Poems</i> from the Digby MS. 102,
&amp;c, edited by Dr. J.&nbsp;Kail, and No. 125, Part I of the
<i>Medieval Records of a London City Church</i> (St. Mary-at-Hill),
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1420-1559, copied and edited by
Mr. Henry Littlehales from the Church Records in the Guildhall, the cost
of the setting and corrections of the text being generously borne by its
Editor. This book will show the income and outlay of the church; the
drink provided for its Palm-Sunday players, its officers’ excursions
into Kent and Essex, its dealing with the Plague, the disposal of its
goods at the Reformation, &amp;c., &amp;c., and will help our members to
realize the church-life of its time. The third Text will be Part I of
<i>An Alphabet of Tales</i>, a&nbsp;very interesting collection,
englisht in the Northern Dialect, about 1440, from the Latin
<i>Alphabetum Narrationum</i> by Etienne de Bésançon, and edited by Mrs.
M.&nbsp;M. Banks from the unique MS. in the King’s Library in the
British Museum; the above-named three texts are now ready for issue.
Those for 1905 and 1906 will probably be chosen from Part II of the
<i>Exeter Book</i>&mdash;Anglo-Saxon Poems from the unique MS. in Exeter
Cathedral&mdash;re-edited by Israel Gollancz, M.A.; Part II of Prof. Dr.
Holthausen’s <i>Vices and Virtues</i>; Part II of <i>Jacob’s Well</i>,
edited by Dr. Brandeis; the Alliterative <i>Siege of Jerusalem</i>,
edited by the late Prof. Dr. E.&nbsp;Kölbing and Prof. Dr. Kaluza; an
Introduction and Glossary to the <i>Minor Poems of the Vernon MS.</i> by
H.&nbsp;Hartley, M.A.; Alain Chartier’s <i>Quadrilogue</i>, edited from
the unique MS. Univ. Coll. Oxford MS. No. 85, by Mr. J.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;H.
Atkins of Owen’s College; a&nbsp;Northern Verse <i>Chronicle of
England</i> to 1327 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>, in 42,000
lines, about 1420 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>, edited by
M.&nbsp;L. Perrin, B.A.; Prof. Bruce’s Introduction to <i>The English
Conquest of Ireland</i>, Part II; and Dr. Furnivall’s edition of the
<i>Lichfield Gilds</i>, which is all printed, and waits only for the
Introduction, that Prof. E.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K. Gonner has kindly undertaken
to write for the book. Canon Wordsworth of Marlborough has given the
Society a copy of the Leofric Canonical Rule, Latin and Anglo-Saxon,
Parker MS. 191, C.C.C. Cambridge, and Prof. Napier will edit it, with a
fragment of the englisht Capitula of Bp. Theodulf. The <i>Coventry Leet
Book</i> is being copied for the Society by Miss M.&nbsp;Dormer
Harris&mdash;helpt by a contribution from the Common Council of the
City,&mdash;and will be publisht by the Society (Miss Harris editing),
as its contribution to our knowledge of the provincial city life of the
15th century.</p>

<p>Dr. Brie of Berlin has undertaken to edit the prose <i>Brut</i> or
<i>Chronicle of Britain</i> attributed to Sir John Mandeville, and
printed by Caxton. He has already examined more than 100 English MSS.
and several French ones, to get the best text, and find out its
source.</p>

<p>The Extra-Series Texts for 1904 will be chosen from Lydgate’s
<i>DeGuilleville’s Pilgrimage of the Life of Man</i>, Part III, edited
by Miss Locock; Dr. M.&nbsp;Konrath’s re-edition of <i>William of
Shorcham’s Poems</i>, Part II; Dr. E.&nbsp;A. Kock’s edition of
Lovelich’s <i>Merlin</i> from the unique MS. in Corpus Christi Coll.,
Cambridge; the <i>Macro Plays</i>, edited from Mr. Gurney’s MS. by Dr.
Furnivall and A.&nbsp;W. Pollard, M.A.; Prof. Erdmann’s re-edition of
Lydgate’s <i>Siege of Thebes</i> (issued also by the Chaucer Society);
Miss Rickert’s re-edition of the Romance of <i>Emare</i>; Prof.
I.&nbsp;Gollanez’s re-edition of two Alliterative Poems, <i>Winner and
Waster</i>, &amp;c, ab. 1360, lately issued for the Roxburghe Club; Dr.
Norman Moore’s re-edition of <i>The Book of the Foundation of St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital, London</i>, from the unique MS. ab. 1425, which
gives an account of the Founder, Rahere, and the miraculous cures
wrought at the Hospital; <i>The Craft of Nombrynge</i>, with other of
the earliest englisht Treatises on Arithmetic, edited by R.&nbsp;Steele,
B.A.; and Miss Warren’s two-text edition of <i>The Dance of Death</i>
from the Ellesmere and other MSS.</p>

<p>These Extra-Series Texts ought to be completed by their Editors: the
Second Part of the prose Romance of <i>Melusine</i>&mdash;Introduction,
with ten facsimiles of the best woodblocks of the old foreign
black-letter editions, Glossary, &amp;c, by A.&nbsp;K. Donald, B.A. (now
in India);
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<!-- png 004 -->
and a new edition of the famous Early-English Dictionary (English and
Latin), <i>Promptorium Parvulorum</i>, from the Winchester MS., ab. 1440
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>: in this, the Editor, the Rev.
A.&nbsp;L. Mayhew, M.A., will follow and print his MS. not only in its
arrangement of nouns first, and verbs second, under every letter of the
Alphabet, but also in its giving of the flexions of the words. The
Society’s edition will thus be the first modern one that really
represents its original, a&nbsp;point on which Mr. Mayhew’s insistence
will meet with the sympathy of all our Members.</p>

<p class = "headnote">
Texts preparing: The Texts for 1906, 1907 &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Texts for the Extra Series in 1906 and 1907 will be chosen from
<i>The Three Kings’ Sons</i>, Part II, the Introduction &amp;c. by Prof.
Dr. Leon Kellner; Part II of <i>The Chester Plays</i>, re-edited from
the MSS., with a full collation of the formerly missing Devonshire MS.,
by Mr. G.&nbsp;England and Dr. Matthews; the Parallel-Text of the only
two MSS. of the <i>Owl and Nightingale</i>, edited by Mr.
G.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;H. Sykes (at press); Prof. Jespersen’s editions of John
Hart’s <i>Orthographie</i> (MS. 1551 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>; blackletter 1569), and <i>Method to teach
Reading</i>, 1570; Deguilleville’s <i>Pilgrimage of the Sowle</i>, in
English prose, edited by Prof. Dr. L.&nbsp;Kellner. (For the three prose
versions of <i>The Pilgrimage of the Life of Man</i>&mdash;two English,
one French&mdash;an Editor is wanted.) Members are askt to realise the
fact that the Society has now 50 years’ work on its Lists,&mdash;at its
present rate of production,&mdash;and that there is from 100 to 200 more
years’ work to come after that. The year 2000 will not see finisht all
the Texts that the Society ought to print. The need of more Members and
money is pressing. Offers of help from willing Editors have continually
to be declined because the Society has no funds to print their
Texts.</p>

<p>An urgent appeal is hereby made to Members to increase the list of
Subscribers to the E.&nbsp;E. Text Society. It is nothing less than a
scandal that the Hellenic Society should have nearly 1000 members, while
the Early English Text Society has not 300!</p>

<p class = "headnote">
Deguilleville.</p>

<p>Before his death in 1895, Mr. G. N. Currie was preparing an edition
of the 15th and 16th century Prose Versions of Guillaume de
Deguilleville’s <i>Pilgrimage of the Life of Man</i>, with the French
prose version by Jean Gallopes, from Lord Aldenham’s MS., he having
generously promist to pay the extra cost of printing the French text,
and engraving one or two of the illuminations in his MS. But Mr. Currie,
when on his deathbed, charged a friend to burn <i>all</i> his MSS. which
lay in a corner of his room, and unluckily all the
E.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;S.’s copies of the Deguilleville prose versions
were with them, and were burnt with them, so that the Society will be
put to the cost of fresh copies, Mr. Currie having died in debt.</p>

<p>Guillaume de Deguilleville, monk of the Cistercian abbey of Chaalis,
in the diocese of Senlis, wrote his first verse <i>Pèlerinaige de
l’Homme</i> in 1330-1 when he was 36.<a class = "tag" name =
"eets_tag_1" id = "eets_tag_1" href = "#eets_note_1">1</a> Twenty-five
(or six) years after, in 1355, he revised his poem, and issued a second
version of it,<a class = "tag" name = "eets_tag_2" id = "eets_tag_2"
href = "#eets_note_2">2</a> a&nbsp;revision of which was printed ab.
1500. Of the prose representative of the first version, 1330-1,
a&nbsp;prose Englishing, about 1430 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>, was edited by Mr. Aldis Wright for the
Roxburghe Club in 1869, from MS. Ff. 5.&nbsp;30 in the Cambridge
University Library. Other copies of this prose English are in the
Hunterian Museum, Glasgow, Q. 2. 25; Sion College, London; and the Laud
Collection in the Bodleian, no. 740.<a class = "tag" name = "eets_tag_3"
id = "eets_tag_3" href = "#eets_note_3">3</a> A&nbsp;copy in the
Northern dialect is MS. G. 21, in St. John’s Coll., Cambridge, and this
is the MS. which will be edited for the E.&nbsp;E. Text Society. The
Laud MS. 740 was somewhat condenst and modernised, in the 17th century,
into MS. Ff. 6.&nbsp;30, in the Cambridge University Library:<a class =
"tag" name = "eets_tag_4" id = "eets_tag_4" href = "#eets_note_4">4</a>
“The Pilgrime or the Pilgrimage of Man in this World,” copied by Will.
Baspoole, whose copy “was verbatim written by Walter Parker, 1645, and
from thence transcribed by G.&nbsp;G. 1649; and from thence by
W.&nbsp;A. 1655.” This last copy may have been read by, or its story
reported to, Bunyan, and may have been the groundwork of his
<i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>. It will be edited for the E.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;T.
Soc., its text running under the earlier English, as in Mr. Herrtage’s
edition of the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i> for the Society. In February
1464,<a class = "tag" name = "eets_tag_5" id = "eets_tag_5" href =
"#eets_note_5">5</a> Jean Gallopes&mdash;a clerk of Angers, afterwards
chaplain to John, Duke of Bedford, Regent of France&mdash;turned
Deguilleville’s first verse <i>Pèlerinaige</i> into a prose
<i>Pèlerinage de la vie humaine</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "eets_tag_6"
id = "eets_tag_6" href = "#eets_note_6">6</a> By the kindness of Lord
Aldenham, as above mentiond, Gallopes’s French text will be printed
opposite the early prose northern Englishing in the Society’s
edition.</p>

<p>The Second Version of Deguilleville’s <i>Pèlerinaige de l’Homme</i>,
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1355 or -6, was englisht in verse
by Lydgate in 1426. Of Lydgate’s poem, the larger part is in the Cotton
MS. Vitellius C. xiii (leaves 2-308). This MS. leaves out Chaucer’s
englishing of Deguilleville’s <i>ABC</i> or <i>Prayer to the Virgin</i>,
of which the successive stanzas start with&nbsp;A, B, C, and run all
thro’ the alphabet; and it has 2 main gaps, besides many small ones from
the tops of leaves being burnt in the Cotton fire. All these gaps (save
the A B&nbsp;C) have been fild up from the Stowe MS. 952 (which old John
Stowe completed) and from the end of the other imperfect MS. Cotton,
Tiberius A vii. Thanks to the diligence of the old Elizabethan tailor
and
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<!-- png 005 -->
manuscript-lover, a complete text of Lydgate’s poem can be given, though
that of an inserted theological prose treatise is incomplete. The
British Museum French MSS. (Harleian 4399,<a class = "tag" name =
"eets_tag_7" id = "eets_tag_7" href = "#eets_note_7">7</a> and
Additional 22,937<a class = "tag" name = "eets_tag_8" id = "eets_tag_8"
href = "#eets_note_8">8</a> and 25,594<a class = "tag" name =
"eets_tag_9" id = "eets_tag_9" href = "#eets_note_9">9</a>) are all of
the First Version.</p>

<p>Besides his first <i>Pèlerinaige de l’homme</i> in its two versions,
Deguilleville wrote a second, “de l’ame separee du corps,” and a third,
“de nostre seigneur Iesus.” Of the second, a&nbsp;prose Englishing of
1413, <i>The Pilgrimage of the Sowle</i> (with poems by Hoccleve,
already printed for the Society with that author’s <i>Regement of
Princes</i>), exists in the Egerton MS. 615,<a class = "tag" name =
"eets_tag_10" id = "eets_tag_10" href = "#eets_note_10">10</a> at
Hatfield, Cambridge (Univ. Kk. 1.&nbsp;7, and Caius), Oxford (Univ.
Coll. and Corpus), and in Caxton’s edition of 1483. This version has
‘somewhat of addicions’ as Caxton says, and some shortenings too, as the
maker of both, the first translater, tells us in the MSS. Caxton leaves
out the earlier englisher’s interesting Epilog in the Egerton MS. This
prose englishing of the <i>Sowle</i> will be edited for the Society by
Prof. Dr. Leon Kellner after that of the <i>Man</i> is finisht, and will
have Gallopes’s French opposite it, from Lord Aldenham’s MS., as his
gift to the Society. Of the Pilgrimage of Jesus, no englishing is
known.</p>

<p class = "headnote">
Anglo-Saxon Psalters.</p>

<p>As to the MS. Anglo-Saxon Psalters, Dr. Hy. Sweet has edited the
oldest MS., the Vespasian, in his <i>Oldest English Texts</i> for the
Society, and Mr. Harsley has edited the latest, c. 1150, Eadwine’s
Canterbury Psalter. The other MSS., except the Paris one, being
interlinear versions,&mdash;some of the Roman-Latin redaction, and some
of the Gallican,&mdash;Prof. Logeman has prepared for press,
a&nbsp;Parallel-Text edition of the first twelve Psalms, to start the
complete work. He will do his best to get the Paris Psalter&mdash;tho’
it is not an interlinear one&mdash;into this collective edition; but the
additional matter, especially in the Verse-Psalms, is very difficult to
manage. If the Paris text cannot be parallelised, it will form a
separate volume. The Early English Psalters are all independent
versions, and will follow separately in due course.</p>

<p>Through the good offices of the Examiners, some of the books for the
Early-English Examinations of the University of London will be chosen
from the Society’s publications, the Committee having undertaken to
supply such books to students at a large reduction in price. The net
profits from these sales will be applied to the Society’s Reprints.</p>

<p>Members are reminded that <i>fresh Subscribers are always wanted</i>,
and that the Committee can at anytime, on short notice, send to press an
additional Thousand Pounds’ worth of work.</p>

<p class = "headnote">
Saints’ Lives.</p>

<p>The Subscribers to the Original Series must be prepared for the issue
of the whole of the Early English <i>Lives of Saints</i>, sooner or
later. The Society cannot leave out any of them, even though some are
dull. The Sinners would doubtless be much more interesting. But in many
Saints’ Lives will be found valuable incidental details of our
forefathers’ social state, and all are worthful for the history of our
language. The Lives may be lookt on as the religious romances or
story-books of their period.</p>

<p>The Standard Collection of Saints’ Lives in the Corpus and Ashmole
MSS., the Harleian MS. 2277, &amp;c. will repeat the Laud set, our No.
87, with additions, and in right order. (The foundation MS. (Laud 108)
had to be printed first, to prevent quite unwieldy collations.) The
Supplementary Lives from the Vernon and other MSS. will form one or two
separate volumes.</p>

<p>Besides the Saints’ Lives, Trevisa’s englishing of <i>Bartholomæus de
Proprietatibus Rerum</i>, the mediæval Cyclopædia of Science, &amp;c,
will be the Society’s next big undertaking. Dr. R. von Fleischhacker
will edit it. Prof. Napier of Oxford, wishing to have the whole of our
MS. Anglo-Saxon in type, and accessible to students, will edit for the
Society all the unprinted and other Anglo-Saxon Homilies which are not
included in Thorpe’s edition of Ælfric’s prose,<a class = "tag" name =
"eets_tag_11" id = "eets_tag_11" href = "#eets_note_11">11</a> Dr.
Morris’s of the Blickling Homilies, and Prof. Skeat’s of Ælfric’s
Metrical Homilies. The late Prof. Kölbing left complete his text, for
the Society, of the <i>Ancren Riwle</i>, from the best MS., with
collations of the other four, and this will be edited for the Society by
Dr. Thümmler. Mr. Harvey means to prepare an edition of the three MSS.
of the <i>Earliest English Metrical Psalter</i>, one of which was edited
by the late Mr. Stevenson for the Surtees Society.</p>

<p>Members of the Society will learn with pleasure that its example has
been followed, not only by the Old French Text Society which has done
such admirable work under its founders Profs. Paul Meyer and Gaston
Paris, but also by the Early Russian Text Society, which was set on foot
in 1877, and has since issued many excellent editions of old MS.
Chronicles, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Members will also note with pleasure the annexation of large tracts
of our Early English territory by the important German contingent, the
late Professors Zupitza and Kölbing, the living Hausknecht, Einenkel,
Haenisch, Kaluza, Hupe, Adam, Holthausen, Schick, Herzfeld, Brandeis,
Sieper, Konrath, Wülfing, &amp;c. Scandinavia has also sent us Prof.
Erdmann and Dr. E.&nbsp;A. Kock; Holland, Prof. H.&nbsp;Logeman, who is
now working in Belgium; France, Prof.
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<!-- png 006 -->
Paul Meyer&mdash;with Gaston Paris as adviser (alas, now
dead);&mdash;Italy, Prof. Lattanzi; Austria, Dr. von Fleischhacker;
while America is represented by the late Prof. Child, by Dr. Mary Noyes
Colvin, Miss Rickert, Profs. Mead, McKnight, Triggs, Perrin, &amp;c. The
sympathy, the ready help, which the Society’s work has cald forth from
the Continent and the United States, have been among the pleasantest
experiences of the Society’s life, a&nbsp;real aid and cheer amid all
troubles and discouragements. All our Members are grateful for it, and
recognise that the bond their work has woven between them and the lovers
of language and antiquity across the seas is one of the most welcome
results of the Society’s efforts.</p>

<p>But that a higher station than an Esquier’s was in store for some of
these henchmen, may be known from the history of one of them. Thomas
Howard, eldest son of Sir John Howard, knight (who was afterwards Duke
of Norfolk, and killed at Bosworth Field), was among these henchmen or
pages, ‘enfauntes’ six or more, of Edward IV.’s. He was made Duke of
Norfolk for his splendid victory over the Scots at Flodden, and Anne

early education in our land. If it should not, I&nbsp;hope that Mr Quick
will carry his pedagogic researches past Henry VIII.’s time, or that one
of our own members will take the subject up. It is worthy of being
thoroughly worked out. For convenience’ sake, the notices I have

<p>One consideration should be premised, that manly exercises, manners
and courtesy, music and singing, knowledge of the order of precedency of
ranks, and ability to carve, were in early times more important than
Latin and Philosophy. ‘Aylmar þe kyng’ gives these directions to
Athelbrus, his steward, as to Horn’s education:</p>

HOUSES OF NOBLES AND CHANCELLORS WERE SCHOOLS.</p>

<p><a name = "pref_educ1" id = "pref_educ1">1.</a>
The chief places of education for the sons of our nobility and gentry
were the houses of other nobles, and specially those of the Chancellors
of our Kings, men not only able to read and write, talk Latin and French
themselves, but in whose hands the Court patronage lay. As early as
Henry the Second’s time (<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>
1154-62), if not before<a class = "tag" name = "pref_gen_tag_11" id =
"pref_gen_tag_11" href = "#pref_gen_note_11">11</a>, this system
prevailed. A&nbsp;friend notes that Fitz-Stephen says of Becket:</p>

<p class = "inset">
“The nobles of the realm of England and of neighbouring kingdoms used to
send their sons to serve the Chancellor, whom he trained with honourable
bringing-up and learning; and when they had received the knight’s belt,
sent them back with honour to their fathers and kindred: some he used to
keep. The king himself, his master, entrusted to him his son, the heir
of the realm, to be brought up; whom he had with him, with many sons of
nobles of the same age, and their proper retinue and masters and proper
servants in the honour due.” &mdash;<i>Vita S.&nbsp;Thomæ</i>,
pp.&nbsp;189, 190, ed. Giles.</p>

<p>Roger de Hoveden, a Yorkshireman, who was a clerk or secretary to
Henry the Second, says of Richard the Lionheart’s unpopular chancellor,
Longchamps the Bishop of Ely:</p>

<p class = "inset">
“All the sons of the nobles acted as his servants, with downcast looks,
nor dared they to look upward towards the heavens unless it so happened
that they were addressing him; and if they attended to anything else
they were pricked with a goad, which their lord held in his hand, fully
mindful of his grandfather of pious memory, who, being of servile
condition in the district of Beauvais, had, for his occupation, to guide
the plough and whip up the oxen; and who at length, to gain his liberty,
fled to the Norman territory.” (Riley’s <i>Hoveden</i>, ii. 232, quoted
in <i>The Cornhill Magazine</i>, vol. xv. p.&nbsp;165.)<a class = "tag"

<p>All Chancellors were not brutes of this kind, but we must remember
that young people were subjected to rough treatment in early days. Even
so late as Henry VI.’s time, Agnes Paston sends to London on the 28th of
January, 1457, to pray the master of her son of 15, that if the boy
“hath not done well, nor will not amend,” his master Greenfield “will
truly belash him till he will amend.” And of the same lady’s treatment
of her marriageable daughter, Elizabeth, Clere writes on the 29th of
June, 1454,</p>

<p class = "inset">
“She (the daughter) was never in so great sorrow as she is now-a-days,
for she may not speak with no man, whosoever come, ne not may see nor
speak with my man, nor with servants of her mother’s, but that she
beareth her on hand otherwise than she meaneth; and she hath since
Easter the most part been beaten once in the week or twice, and
sometimes twice on a day, and her head broken in two or three places.”
(v. i. p.&nbsp;50, col. 1, ed. 1840.)</p>

<p>The treatment of Lady Jane Grey by her parents was also very severe,
as she told Ascham, though she took it meekly, as her sweet nature
was:</p>

<p class = "inset">
“One of the greatest benefites that God ever gave me, is, that he sent
me so sharpe and severe Parentes, and so jentle a scholemaster. For when
I am in presence either of father or mother, whether I speake, kepe
silence, sit, stand, or go, eate, drinke, be merie or sad, be sewyng,
plaiyng, dauncing, or doing anie thing els, I&nbsp;must do it, as it
were, in soch weight, mesure, and number, even so perfitelie as God made
the world, or els I am so sharplie taunted, so cruellie threatened; yea
presentlie some tymes, with pinches, nippes, and bobbes, and other waies
which I will not name for the honor I beare them, so without measure
misordered, that I thinke my self in hell till tyme cum that I must go
to <i>M. Elmer</i>, who teacheth me so jentlie, so pleasantlie, with
soch faire allurementes to learning, that I thinke all the tyme nothing
whiles I am with him. And when I am called from him, I&nbsp;fall on
weeping.” &mdash;<i>The Scholemaster</i>, ed. Mayor.</p>

<p>The inordinate beating<a class = "tag" name = "pref_gen_tag_13" id =

"#pref_gen_note_14">14</a>&mdash;Ascham denounces strongly in the first
book of his <i>Scholemaster</i>, and he contrasts their folly in beating
into their scholars the hatred of learning with the practice of the wise
riders who by gentle allurements breed them up in the love of riding.
Indeed, the origin of his book was Sir Wm. Cecil’s saying to him “I have
strange news brought me this morning, that divers scholars of Eton be
run away from the school for fear of beating.”</p>

<p>Sir Peter Carew, says Mr Froude, being rather a troublesome boy, was
chained in the Haccombe dog-kennel till he ran away from&nbsp;it.</p>

“received into the house of the right reverend, wise, and learned
prelate Cardinal Morton, where, though he was young of years, yet would
he at Christmas-tide suddenly sometimes step in among the players, and
never studying for the matter make a part of his own there presently
among them, which made the lookers on more sport than all the players
beside. In whose wit and towardness the Cardinal much delighting would
say of him unto the nobles that divers times dined with him, <i>This
child here waiting at the table, Whosoever shall live to see it, will
prove a marvellous man.</i> Whereupon for his better furtherance in

being at the last more conversant with Mistress Anne Boleyn than with

<p>Among the persons daily attendant upon Wolsey in his house,
down-lying and up-rising, Cavendish enumerates “of Lords nine or ten,
who had each of them allowed two servants; and the Earl of Derby had
allowed five men” (p.&nbsp;36-7). On this Singer prints a note, which
looks like a guess, signed <i>Growe</i>, “Those Lords that were placed
in the great and privy chambers were <i>Wards</i>, and as such paid for
their board and education.” It will be seen below that he had a
particular officer called “Instructor of his Wards” (<i>Cavendish</i>,
p.&nbsp;38, l.&nbsp;2). Why I suppose the note to be a guess is, because
at p.&nbsp;33 Cavendish has stated that Wolsey “had also a great number
daily attending upon him, both of noblemen and worthy gentlemen, of
great estimation and possessions,&mdash;with no small number of the
tallest yeomen that he could get in all his realm; in so much that well
was that nobleman and gentleman that might prefer any tall and comely
yeoman unto his service.”</p>

that such youths would be found in the house of every noble of
importance I believe, for as Walter Mapes (?&nbsp;ab. 1160-90 <span
class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>) says of the great nobles, in his poem
<i>De diversis ordinibus hominum</i>, the example of manners goes out
from their houses, <i>Exemplar morum domibus procedit eorum</i>. That
these houses were in some instances only the finishing schools for our
well-born young men after previous teaching at home and at College is
possible (though the cases of Sir Thomas More and Ascham are exactly the
other way), but the Lord Percy last named had a schoolmaster in his
house, “The Maister of Graimer j”, p.&nbsp;254; “Lyverays for the
Maister of Gramer<a class = "tag" name = "pref_gen_tag_20" id =

and if the Pastons are to be taken as a type of their class, our nobles
and gentry at the end of the 15th century must have been able to read
and write freely. Chaucer’s Squire could write, and though the custom of
sealing deeds and not signing them prevailed, more or less, till Henry
VIII.’s time, it is doubtful whether this implied inability of the
sealers to write. Mr Chappell says that in Henry VIII.’s time half our
nobility were then writing ballads. Still, the bad spelling and grammar
of most of the letters up to that period, and the general ignorance of
our upper classes were, says Professor Brewer, the reason why the whole
government of the country was in the hands of ecclesiastics. Even in
Henry the Eighth’s

could speak French with any degree of fluency, and so was learned enough
to be sent on an embassy abroad. But this may be questioned. Yet Wolsey,

pains to go down into the hall to encounter and to receive them,

It remains that I now explain to you what moves me to compile and
publish a treatise with this title. When, two years ago, more or less,
I&nbsp;had returned to my native land from the city of Rome, I&nbsp;was
present at a certain feast, a&nbsp;stranger to many; where, when enough
had been drunk, one or other of the guests&mdash;no fool, as one might
infer from his words and countenance&mdash;began to talk of educating
his children well. And, first of all, he thought that he must search out
a good teacher for them, and that they should at any rate attend school.
There happened to be present one of those whom we call gentle-men
(<i>generosos</i>), and who always carry some horn hanging at their
backs, as though they would hunt during dinner. He, hearing letters
praised, roused with sudden anger, burst out furiously with these words.
“Why do you talk nonsense, friend?” he said; “A curse on those stupid
letters! all learned men are beggars: even Erasmus, the most learned of
all, is a beggar (as I hear), and in a certain letter of his calls <span
class = "greek" title = "tên kataraton penian">τήν κατάρατον

complains that he cannot shake her off his shoulders right into <span
class = "greek" title = "bathukêtea ponton">βαθυκήτεα πόντον</span>,
that is, into the deep sea. I&nbsp;swear by God’s body I’d rather that
my son should hang than study letters. For it becomes the sons of
gentlemen to blow the horn nicely (<i>apte</i>), to hunt skilfully, and
elegantly carry and train a hawk. But the study of letters should be
left to the sons of rustics.” At this point I could not restrain myself
from answering something to this most talkative man, in defence of good
letters. “You do not seem to me, good man,” I&nbsp;said, “to think
rightly. For if any foreigner were to come to the king, such as the
ambassadors (<i>oratores</i>) of princes are, and an answer had to be
given to him, your son, if he were educated as you wish, could only blow
his horn, and the learned sons of rustics would be called to answer, and
would be far preferred to your hunter or fowler son; and they, enjoying
their learned liberty, would say to your face, ‘We prefer to be learned,
and, thanks to our learning, no fools, than boast of our fool-like
nobility.’” Then he upon this, looking round, said, “Who is this person
that is talking like this? I&nbsp;don’t know the fellow.” And when some
one whispered in his ear who I was, he muttered something or other in a
low voice to himself; and finding a fool to listen to him, he then
caught hold of a cup of wine. And when he
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
<a name = "pagexiv" id = "pagexiv"> </a>

could get nothing to answer, he began to drink, and change the
conversation to other things. And thus I was freed from the disputing of
this mad fellow,&mdash;which I was dreadfully afraid would have lasted a
long time,&mdash;not by Apollo, like Horace was from his babbler, but by
Bacchus.</p>

APPRENTICESHIP IN HENRY VII.’S TIME.</p>

<p>On the general subject it should be noted that Fleta mentions nothing
about boarders or apprentices in his account of household economy; nor
does the <i>Liber Contrarotulatoris Garderobæ Edw. I<sup>mi</sup></i>
mention any young noblemen as part of the King’s household. That among
tradesmen in later times, putting out their children in other houses,
and apprenticeships, were the rule, we know from many statements and
allusions in our literature, and “The Italian Relation of England”
(temp. Hen. VII.) mentions that the Duke of Suffolk was boarded out to a
rich old widow, who persuaded him to marry her (p.&nbsp;27). It also
says</p>

<p class = "inset">
The want of affection in the English is strongly manifested towards
their children; for after having kept them at home till they arrive at
the age of 7 or 9 years at the utmost, they put them out, both males and
females, to hard service in the houses of other people, binding them
generally for another 7 or 9 years. And these are called apprentices,
and during that time they perform all the most menial offices; and few
are born who are exempted from this fate, for every one, however rich he
may be, sends away his children into the houses of others, whilst he, in
return, receives those of strangers into his own. And on inquiring their
reason for this severity, they answered that they did it in order that
their children might learn better manners. But I, for my part, believe
that they do it because they like to enjoy all their comforts
themselves, and that they are better served by strangers than they would
be by their own children. Besides which, the English being great
epicures, and very avaricious by nature, indulge in the most delicate
fare themselves and give their household the coarsest bread, and beer,
and cold meat baked on Sunday for the week, which, however, they allow
them in great abundance. That if they had their own children at home,
they would be obliged to give them the same food they made use of for
themselves. That if the English sent their children away from home to
learn virtue and good manners, and took them back again when their
apprenticeship was over, they might, perhaps, be excused; but they never
return, for the girls are settled by their patrons, and the boys make
the best marriages they can, and, assisted by their patrons, not by
their fathers, they also open a house and strive diligently by this
means to make some fortune for themselves; whence it proceeds that,
having no hope of their paternal inheritance, that all become so

greedy of gain that they feel no shame in asking, almost “for the love
of God,” for the smallest sums of money; and to this it may be
attributed, that there is no injury that can be committed against the
lower orders of the English, that may not be atoned for by money.

GIRLS SENT OUT TO LADIES’ HOUSES.</p>

<p>That girls, as well as boys, were sent out to noblemen’s houses for
their education, is evident from Margaret Paston’s letter of the 3rd of
April, 1469, to Sir John Paston, “Also I would ye should purvey for your
sister [?&nbsp;Margery] to be with my Lady of Oxford, or with my Lady of
Bedford, or in some other worshipful place whereas ye think best, and I
will help to her finding, for we be either of us weary of other.” Alice
Crane’s Letter, in the Paston Letters, v.&nbsp;i.
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>

<!-- png 034 -->
p.&nbsp;35, ed. 1840, also supports this view, as does Sir John
Heveningham’s to Margaret Paston, asking her to take his cousin Anneys
Loveday for some time as a boarder till a mistress could be found for
her. “If that it please you to have her with you to into the time that a
mistress may be purveyed for her, I&nbsp;pray you thereof, and I shall
content you for her board that ye shall be well pleased.” Similarly Anne
Boleyn and her sister were sent to Margaret of Savoy, aunt of Charles
V., who lived at Brussels, to learn courtesy, &amp;c., says Prof.
Brewer. Sir Roger Twysden says that Anne was “Not above seven yeares of
age, Anno 1514,” when she went abroad. He adds:</p>

<p class = "inset">
“It should seeme by some that she served three in France successively;
Mary of England maryed to Lewis the twelfth, an. 1514, with whome she
went out of England, but Lewis dying the first of January following, and
that Queene (being) to returne home, sooner than either Sir Thomas
Bullen or some other of her frendes liked she should, she was preferred
to Clauda, daughter to Lewis XII. and wife to Francis I. then Queene (it
is likely upon the commendation of Mary the Dowager), who not long after
dying, an. 1524, not yet weary of France she went to live with
Marguerite, Dutchess of Alançon and Berry, a&nbsp;Lady much commended
for her favor towards good letters, but never enough for the Protestant
religion then in the infancy&mdash;from her, if I am not deceived, she
first learnt the grounds of the Protestant religion; so that England may
seem to owe some part of her happyness derived from that Lady.”
(Twysden’s Notes quoted by Singer in his ed. of Cavendish’s Life of
Wolsey, 1825, p.&nbsp;57.)</p>

<p>As Henry VIII. fell in love with his wife’s maid of
honour,&mdash;“began to kindle the brand of amours” at the light of Anne
Boleyn’s beauty, “her excellent gesture and behaviour,”&mdash;so we find
in later times rich young men became enamoured of poor young women
staying in the same house with them. Mr Bruce sends me an instance:</p>

<div class = "inset">

family in Wiltshire.”</p>

considerable convents, especially those that were honoured with the
mitre, to receive into their own private lodgings the sons of the
principal families of the neighbourhood for education. About the year
1450, Thomas Bromele, abbot of the mitred monastery of Hyde near
Winchester, entertained in his own abbatial house within that monastery
eight young gentlemen, or <i>gentiles pueri</i>, who were placed there
for the purpose of literary instruction, and constantly dined at the
abbot’s table. I&nbsp;will not scruple to give the original words, which
are more particular and expressive, of the obscure record which
preserves this curious anecdote of monastic life. ‘<i>Pro octo

Wingfield, who furnished money for his education, and placed Roger,
together with his own sons, under a tutor whose name was Bond. The boy
had by nature a taste for books, and showed his good taste by reading
English in preference to Latin, with wonderful eagerness. This was the
more remarkable from the fact that Latin was still the language of
literature, and it is not likely that the few English books written at
that time were at all largely spread abroad in places far away from the
Universities and Cathedral towns. In or about the year 1530, Mr Bond the
domestic tutor resigned the charge of young Roger, who was now about
fifteen years old, and by the advice and pecuniary aid of his kind
patron Sir Antony, he was enabled to enter St John’s College, Cambridge,
at that time the most famous seminary of learning in all England ... he
took his bachelor’s degree in 1531, Feb. 18, in the 18th year of his age

<p>Of the course of study of ‘well-bred youths’ in the early years of
Elizabeth’s reign we have an interesting account by Sir Nicholas Bacon,
Lord Keeper, father of the great Bacon, in a Paper by Mr J.&nbsp;Payne
Collier in the <i>Archæologia</i>, vol. 36, Part 2, p.&nbsp;339, Article
xxxi.<a class = "tag" name = "pref_gen_tag_33" id = "pref_gen_tag_33"
href = "#pref_gen_note_33">33</a> “Before he became Lord Keeper, Sir
Nicholas Bacon had been Attorney of that Court” [the Court of Wards and
Liveries] “a most lucrative appointment; and on the 27th May, 1561, he
addressed a letter to Sir William Cecil, then recently (Jan., 1561) made
Master of the Wards, followed by a paper thus entitled:&mdash;’Articles
devised for the bringing up in vertue and learning of the Queenes
Majesties Wardes, being heires males, and whose landes, descending in
possession and coming to the Queenes Majestie, shall amount to the
cleere yearly value of c. markes, or above.’” Sir Nicholas asks the new
Master of Wards to reform what he justly calls most “preposterous”
abuses in the department:&mdash;“That the proceeding hath bin
preposterous, appeareth by this: the chiefe thinge, and most of price,
in wardeship, is the wardes mynde; the next to that, his bodie; the

last and meanest, his land. Nowe, hitherto the chiefe care of
governaunce hath bin to the land, being the meaneste; and to the bodie,
being the better, very small; but to the mynde, being the best, none at
all, which methinkes is playnely to sett the carte before the horse”
(p.&nbsp;343). Mr Collier then summarises Bacon’s Articles for the
bringing up of the Wards thus: “The wards are to attend divine service
at six in the morning: nothing is said about breakfast,<a class = "tag"
name = "pref_gen_tag_34" id = "pref_gen_tag_34" href =
"#pref_gen_note_34">34</a> but they are to study Latin until eleven; to
dine between 11 and 12; to study with the music-master from 12 till 2;
from 2 to 3 they are to be with the French master; and from 3 to 5 with
the Latin and Greek masters. At 5 they are to go to evening prayers;
then they are to sup; to be allowed honest pastimes till 8; and, last of
all, before they go to bed at 9, they are again to apply themselves to
music under the instruction of the master. At and after the age of 16
they were to attend lectures upon temporal and civil law, as well as
<i>de disciplinâ militari</i>. It is not necessary to insert farther
details; but what I have stated will serve to show how well-bred youths
of that period were usually brought up, and how disgracefully the duty
of education as regards wards was neglected.... It may appear singular
that in these articles drawn up by Sir Nicholas, so much stress is laid
upon instruction in music<a class = "tag" name = "pref_gen_tag_35" id =
"pref_gen_tag_35" href = "#pref_gen_note_35">35</a>; but it only serves
to confirm the notion that the science was then most industriously
cultivated by nearly every class of society.” Pace in 1517 requires that
every one should study it, but should join with it some other study, as
Astrology or Astronomy. He says also that the greatest part of the art
had perished by men’s negligence; “For all that our musicians do
now-a-days, is almost trivial if compared with what the old ones
(<i>antiqui</i>) did, so that now hardly one or two (<i>unus aut
alter</i>) can be found who know what harmony is, though the word is
always on their tongue.” (<i>De Fructu</i>, p.&nbsp;54-5.) Ascham, while
lamenting in 1545 (<i>Toxophilus</i>, p.&nbsp;29) ‘that the laudable
custom of

England to teach children their plain song and prick-song’ is ‘so
decayed throughout all the realm as it is,’ denounces the great practise
of instrumental music by older students: “the minstrelsy of lutes,
pipes, harps, and all other that standeth by such nice, fine, minikin
fingering, (such as the most part of scholars whom I know use, if they
use any,) is far more fit, for the womanishness of it, to dwell in the
Court among ladies, than for any great thing in it which should help
good and sad study, to abide in the University among scholars.”</p>

NEGLECT OF EDUCATION BY MOTHERS.</a></p>

<p>By <ins class = "edcorr" title = "corrected by author from ‘1574’">1577</ins> our rich people, according to Harrison, attended
properly to the education of their children. After speaking “of our
women, whose beautie commonlie exceedeth the fairest of those of the
maine,” he says:</p>

<p class = "inset">
“This neuerthelesse I vtterlie mislike in the poorer sort of them, for
the wealthier doo sildome offend herein: that being of themselues
without competent wit, they are so carelesse in the education of their
children (wherein their husbands also are to be blamed,) by means
whereof verie manie of them neither fearing God, neither regarding
either manners or obedience, do oftentimes come to confusion, which (if
anie correction or discipline had beene vsed toward them in youth) might
haue prooued good members of their common-wealth &amp; countrie, by
their good seruice and industrie.” &mdash;<i>Descr. of Britaine</i>,
Holinshed, i. 115, col.&nbsp;2.</p>

<p>This is borne out by Ascham, who says that young men up to 17 were
well looked after, but after that age were turned loose to get into all
the mischief they liked:</p>

<p class = "inset">
“In deede, from seven to seventene, yong jentlemen commonlie be

and speciallie soch as do live in the Court. And that which is most to
be merveled at, commonlie the wisest and also best men be found the
fondest fathers in this behalfe. And if som good father wold seek some
remedie herein, yet the mother (if the household of our Lady) had
rather, yea, and will to, have her sonne cunnyng and bold, in making him
to lyve trimlie when he is yong, than by learning and travell to be able
to serve his Prince &amp; his countrie, both wiselie in peace, and
stoutlie in warre, whan he is old.</p>

custom of princes in having private tutors for their boys, and
withdrawing them from public schools where the spirit of emulation
against other boys would make them work. The course he recommends is,
that rich people should send their sons, with their tutors, to the
public schools, and so get the advantage of both kinds of tuition.</p>

Reformation drew nearer, while the clergy were sinking lower and lower,
a&nbsp;marked change for the better became perceptible in a portion at

<p>But Grosseteste mentions a “noble” scholar at Oxford (<i>Epist.</i>
129), and Edward the Black Prince and Henry V. are said to have been
students of Queen’s College, Oxford. Wolsey himself was a College tutor

Ingulfus, who was Abbot of Croyland, in the Isle of Ely, under William

and Codex, in which their most essential parts were preserved, with some

UNDERGRADUATE’S EXPENSES AT OXFORD, 1478.</p>

<p>‘The Paston Letters’ do not give us much information about studies or
life at Oxford, but they do give us material for estimating the cost of
a student there (ii. 124<a class = "tag" name = "pref_gen_tag_43" id =
"pref_gen_tag_43" href = "#pref_gen_note_43">43</a>); they show us the
tutor reporting to a mother her son’s progress in learning (ii. 130),
and note the custom of a man, when made bachelor, giving a feast: “I was
made bachelor ... on Friday was se’nnight (18 June, 1479), and I made my
feast on the Monday after (21 June). I&nbsp;was promised venison against
my feast, of my Lady Harcourt, and of another person too, but I was
deceived of both; but my guests held them pleased with such meat as they
had, blessed be God.” The letter as to the costs is dated May 19,
1478.</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p>“I marvel sore that you sent me no word of the letter which I sent to
you by Master William Brown at Easter. I&nbsp;sent you word that time
that I should send you mine expenses particularly; but as at this time
the bearer hereof had a letter suddenly that he should come home, &amp;
therefore I could have no leisure to send them to you on that wise,
&amp; therefore I shall write to you in this letter the whole sum of my
expenses since I was with you till Easter last past, and
<span class = "pagenum">xxx</span>

also the receipts, reckoning the twenty shillings that I had of you to
Oxon wards, with the bishop’s finding:&mdash;</p>

<p>and yet I reckon none expenses since Easter; but as for them, they be

</div>

<p>On this account Fenn says,</p>

<p class = "inset">
“he (Wm. Paston) had expended £6 5<i>s.</i> 5¾<i>d.</i> from the time he
left his mother to Easter last, which this year fell on the 22nd March,
from which time it was now two months, &amp; of the expenses ‘since
incurred’ he says ‘they be not great.’ We may therefore conclude the
former account was from the Michaelmas preceding, and a moderate one; if
so, we may fairly estimate his university education at £100 a-year of
our present money. I&nbsp;mean that £12 10<i>s.</i> 11½<i>d.</i> would
then procure as many necessaries and comforts as £100 will at this
day.”</p>

<p>What was the basis of Fenn’s calculation he does not say. In 1468,
the estimates for the Duke of Clarence’s household expenses give these
prices, among others:</p>

<p>This sum would make the things named nearly 14 times as dear now as
in 1468, and raise Fenn’s £100 to about £180; but no reliance can be
placed on this estimate because we know nothing of the condition of the
beves, muttons, veles, and porkys, then, as contrasted

with ours. Possibly they were half the size and half the weight. Still,
I&nbsp;have referred the question to Professor Thorold Rogers, author of
the <i>History of Prices</i> 1250-1400 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>, and he says:</p>

<p class = "inset">
“In the year to which you refer (1478) bread was very dear, 50 per cent.
above the average. But on the whole, wheat prices in the 15th century
were lower than in the 14th. Fenn’s calculation, a&nbsp;little below the
mark for wheat, is still less below it in most of the second necessaries
of life. The multiple of wheat is about 9, that of meat at least 24,
those of butter and cheese nearly as much. But that of clothing is not
more than 6, that of linen from 4 to&nbsp;5. Taking however one thing
with another, 12 is a safe general multiplier.”</p>

<p>This would make the cost of young Paston’s university education £150
11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a year.</p>

<p>Mr Whiston would raise Fenn’s estimate of £100 to £200. He says that
the rent of land in Kent in 1540 was a shilling or eighteenpence an
acre,&mdash;see <i>Valor Ecclesiasticus</i>,&mdash;and that the tithes
and glebes of the Dean and Chapter of Rochester, which were worth about
£480 a-year in 1542, are now worth £19,000.</p>

<p>The remaining Oxford letter in the Paston volumes seems to allude to
the students bearing part of the expenses of the degree, or the feast at
it, of a person related to royal family.</p>

Whitgift for one, see his Life of Strype, Bk.&nbsp;I. chap. xiii.

“at this present, of one sort &amp; other, there are about three
thousand students nourished in them both (as by a late serveie it
manifestlie appeared). They [the Colleges at our Universities] were
created by their founders at the first, onelie for pore men’s sons,
whose parents were not able to bring them up unto learning: but now they
have the least benefit of them, by reason the rich do so incroch upon
them. And so farre hath this inconvenence spread itself, that it is in
my time an hard matter for a pore man’s child to come by a fellowship
(though he be neuer so good a scholer &amp; worthie of that roome.) Such
packing also is used at elections, that not he which best deserveth, but
he that hath most friends, though he be the worst scholer, is alwaies
surest to speed; which will turne in the end to the overthrow of
learning. That some gentlemen also, whose friends have been in times
past benefactors to certeine of those houses, doe intrude into the
disposition of their estates, without all respect of order or statutes
devised by the founders, onelie thereby to place whome they think good
(and not without some hope of gaine) the case is <ins class = "mycorr"

soone take place, if their superiors did not provide to bridle their

these universities, it is lamentable to see what briberie is used;

for yer the scholer can be preferred, such briberye is made, that pore
men’s children are commonly shut out, and the richer sort received (who
in times past thought it dishonour to live as it were upon almes) and
yet being placed, most of them studie little other than histories,
tables, dice &amp; trifles, as men that make not the living by their
studie the end of their purposes; which is a lamentable bearing. Besides
this, being for the most part either gentlemen, or rich men’s sonnes,
they oft bring the universities into much slander.<a class = "tag" name

dailie trade up the youth there abiding privatlie in their halles, to
the end they may be able afterwards (when their turne commeth about,
which is after twelve termes) to show themselves abroad, by going from
thence into the common schooles and publike disputations (as it were
<i>In aream</i>) there to trie their skilles, and declare how they have
profited since their coming thither.</p>

<p class = "inset">
“Moreover in the publike schooles of both the universities, there are
found at the prince’s charge (and that verie largelie) five professors

physicke, the Hebrew and the Greek tongues. And for the other lectures,
as of philosophie, logike, rhetorike and the quadriuials, although the
latter (I&nbsp;mean, arithmetike, musike, geometrie and astronomie, and
with them all skill in the perspectives are now smallie regarded in
either of them) the universities themselves do allowe competent stipends
to such as reade the same, whereby they are sufficiently provided for,

<p>On the introduction of the study of Greek into the Universities, Dr
S.&nbsp;Knight says in his <i>Life of Colet</i>:</p>

famous <i>Grocyne</i> learned the first Elements thereof.</p>

<p>“In <i>Cambridge</i>, <i>Erasmus</i> was the first who taught the
<i>Greek Grammar</i>. And so very low was the State of Learning in that
University, that (as he tells a Friend) about the Year 1485, the
Beginning of <i>Hen.</i> VII. Reign, there was nothing taught in that
publick Seminary besides <i>Alexander’s Parva Logicalia</i>, (as they
called them) the old <i>Axioms</i> of <i>Aristotle</i>, and the
<i>Questions</i> of John Scotus, till in Process of time <i>good
Letters</i> were brought in, and some Knowledge of the

<p>“It is certain that even <i>Erasmus</i> himself did little understand
<i>Greek</i>, when he came first into <i>England</i>, in 1497 (13
<i>Hen.</i> VII.), and that our Countryman <i>Linacer</i> taught it him,
being just returned from <i>Italy</i> with great Skill in that Language:

<p>The age at which boys went up to the University seems to have varied
greatly. When Oxford students were forbidden to play marbles they could
not have been very old. But in “The Mirror of the Periods of Man’s Life”
(?&nbsp;ab. 1430 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>), in the
Society’s <i>Hymns to the Virgin and Christ</i> of this year, we find
the going-up age put at twenty:</p>

<p>An English <i>nation</i> or set of students of the Faculty of Arts at
Paris existed in 1169; after 1430 the name was changed to the German

Irish, Poles, Germans, &amp;c. &mdash;<i>Encyc. Brit.</i> John of
Salisbury (born 1110) says that he was twelve years studying at Paris on

lingers in England, how a friend of my own was curate in a Surrey

Reading to be taught in his school; how another clergyman lately

NO BONDSMAN’S SON TO BE AN APPRENTICE.</p>

<p>The early practice of the Freemasons, and other crafts, refusing to
let any member take a bondsman’s son as an apprentice, was founded on
the reasonable apprehension that his lord would or might afterwards
claim the lad, make him disclose the trade-secrets, and carry on his art
for the lord’s benefit. The fourth of the ‘Fyftene artyculus or fyftene

POST-REFORMATION CATHEDRAL SCHOOLS.</p>

<p><i>Cathedral Schools.</i> About the pre-Reformation Schools I can
find only the extract from Tanner given above, p. xlii. On the
post-Reformation Schools I refer readers to Mr Whiston’s <i>Cathedral
Trusts</i>, 1850. He says:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xlix</span>

<p class = "inset">
“The Cathedrals of England are of two kinds, those of the old and those
of the new foundation: of the latter, Canterbury (the old archiepiscopal
see) and Carlisle, Durham, Ely, Norwich, Rochester, and Worcester, old
episcopal sees, were <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1541-2
refounded, or rather reformed, by Henry VIII. ... Besides these, he
created five other cathedral churches or colleges, in connexion with the
five new episcopal sees of Bristol, Chester, Gloucester, Oxford, and
Peterborough. He further created the see of Westminster, which was ...
subsequently (<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1560) converted to
a deanery collegiate by Queen Elizabeth ... (p.&nbsp;6). The preamble of
the Act 31 Henry VIII. c. 9, for founding the new cathedrals, preserved
in Henry’s own handwriting, recites that they were established ‘To the
intente that Gods worde myght the better be sett forthe, <i>cyldren
broght up in lernynge, clerces nuryshyd in the universities</i>, olde
servantes decayed, to have lyfing, allmes housys for pour folke to be

stypende</i>, dayly almes to be mynistrate, mending of hyght wayes, and
exhybision for mynisters of the chyrche.’”</p>

<p>“A general idea of the scope and nature of the cathedral
establishments, as originally planned and settled by Henry VIII., may be
formed from the first chapter of the old statutes of Canterbury, which
is almost identical with the corresponding chapter of the statutes of
all the other cathedrals of the new foundation. It is as follows:</p>

boys to be instructed in grammar, were to take their meals. There was

supply the place of the old religious houses, <i>i.e.</i>, in the

<p>“Now £300 at that time was worth about £5,000 now, so that these
schools were <i>designed</i> for the lower ranks of society, and open to
the sons of the poorer gentry.</p>

<p>“An interesting illustration of this [and of the class-feeling in
education at this time] is supplied,” says Mr Whiston, “by the narrative
of what took place&mdash;</p>

<p class = "inset">
“when the Cathedral Church of Canterbury was altered from monks to
secular men of the clergy, viz.: prebendaries or canons, petty-canons,
choristers and scholars. At this erection were present, Thomas Cranmer,
archbishop, with divers other commissioners. And nominating and electing
such convenient and fit persons as should serve for the furniture of the
said Cathedral church according to the new foundation, it came to pass
that, when they should elect the children of the Grammar school, there
were of the commissioners more than one or two who would have none
admitted but sons or younger brethren of gentlemen. As for other,
husbandmen’s children, they were more meet, they said, for the plough,
and to be artificers, than to occupy the place of the learned sort; so
that they wished none else to be put to school, but only gentlemen’s
children.
<span class = "headnote">
POOR MEN’S SONS HAVE HEADS AS WELL AS RICH ONES’.</span>
Whereunto the most reverend father, the Archbishop, being of a contrary
mind, said, ‘That he thought it not indifferent so to order the matter;
for,’ said he, ‘poor men’s children are many times endued with more
singular gifts of nature, which are also the gifts of God, as, with
eloquence, memory, apt pronunciation, sobriety, and such like; and also
commonly more apt to apply their study, than is the gentleman’s son,
delicately educated.’ Hereunto it was on the other part replied, ‘that
it was meet for the ploughman’s son to go to plough, and the artificer’s
son to apply the trade of his parent’s vocation; and the gentleman’s
children are meet to have the knowledge of government and rule in the
commonwealth. For we have,’ said they, ‘as much need of ploughmen as any
other state; and all sorts of men may not go to school.’ ‘I grant,’
replied the Archbishop, ‘much of your meaning herein as needful in a
commonwealth; but yet utterly to exclude the ploughman’s son and the
poor man’s son from the benefits of learning, as though they were
unworthy to have
<span class = "pagenum">lii</span>
<a name = "pagelii" id = "pagelii"> </a>
<!-- png 070 -->
the gifts of the Holy Ghost bestowed upon them as well as upon others,
is as much to say, as that Almighty God should not be at liberty to
bestow his great gifts of grace upon any person, nor nowhere else but as
we and other men shall appoint them to be employed, according to our
fancy, and not according to his most goodly will and pleasure, who
giveth his gifts both of learning, and other perfections in all
sciences, unto all kinds and states of people indifferently. Even so
doth he many times withdraw from them and their posterity again those
beneficial gifts, if they be not thankful. If we should shut up into a
strait corner the bountiful grace of the Holy Ghost, and thereupon
attempt to build our fancies, we should make as perfect a work thereof
as those that took upon them to build the Tower of Babel; for God would
so provide that the offspring of our first-born children should
peradventure become most unapt to learn, and very dolts, as I myself
have seen no small number of them very dull and without all manner of
capacity. And to say the truth, I&nbsp;take it, that none of us all
here, being gentlemen born (as I think), but had our beginning that way
from a low and base parentage; and through the benefit of learning, and
other civil knowledge, for the most part all gentlemen ascend to their
estate.’ Then it was again answered, that the most part of the nobility
came up by feats of arms and martial acts. ‘As though,’ said the
Archbishop, ‘that the noble captain was always unfurnished of good
learning and knowledge to persuade and dissuade his army rhetorically;
who rather that way is brought unto authority than else his manly looks.
To conclude; the poor man’s son by pains-taking will for the most part
be learned when the gentleman’s son will not take the pains to get it.
And we are taught by the Scriptures that Almighty God raiseth up from
the dunghill, and setteth him in high authority. And whensoever it
pleaseth him, of his divine providence, he deposeth princes unto a right
humble and poor estate. Wherefore, if the gentleman’s son be apt to
learning, let him be admitted; if not apt, let the poor man’s child that
is apt enter his room.’ With words to the like effect.”</p>

<p>About 1174 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>, Fitzstephen speaks
of the London schools and scholars thus:&mdash;I use Pegge’s
translation, 1772, to which Mr Chappell referred&nbsp;me,&mdash;</p>

<p class = "inset">
“The three principal churches in London<a class = "tag" name =
"pref_gen_tag_75" id = "pref_gen_tag_75" href =

with schools, and they are all very flourishing. Often indeed through
the favour and countenance of persons eminent in philosophy, more
schools are permitted. On festivals, at those churches where the Feast
of the Patron Saint is solemnized, the masters convene their scholars.
The youth, on that occasion, dispute, some in the demonstrative way, and
some logically. These produce their enthymemes, and those the more
perfect syllogisms. Some, the better to shew their parts, are exercised
in disputation, contending with one another, whilst others are put upon
establishing some truth by way of illustration. Some sophists endeavour
to apply, on feigned topics, a&nbsp;vast heap and flow of words, others
to impose upon you with

false conclusions. As to the orators, some with their rhetorical
harangues employ all the powers of persuasion, taking care to observe
the precepts of art, and to omit nothing opposite to the subject. The
boys of different schools wrangle with one another in verse; contending
about the principles of Grammar, or the rules of the Perfect Tenses and
Supines. Others there are, who in Epigrams, or other compositions in
numbers, use all that low ribaldry we read of in the Ancients; attacking
their school-masters, but without mentioning names, with the old
Fescennine licentiousness, and discharging their scoffs and sarcasms
against them; touching the foibles of their school-fellows, or perhaps
of greater personages, with true Socratic wit, or biting them more
keenly with a Theonine tooth: The audience, fully disposed to laugh,</p>

</div>

<p>Of the sports of the boys, Fitzstephen gives a long description. On
Shrove-Tuesday, each boy brought his fighting cock to his master, and
they had a cock-fight all morning in the school-room.<a class = "tag"
name = "pref_gen_tag_76" id = "pref_gen_tag_76" href =
"#pref_gen_note_76">76</a> After dinner, football in the fields of the
suburbs, probably Smithfield. Every Sunday in Lent they had a
sham-fight, some on horseback, some on foot, the King and his Court
often looking on. At Easter they played at the Water-Quintain, charging
a target, which if they missed, souse they went into the water. ‘On
holidays in summer the pastime of the youths is to exercise themselves
in archery, in running, leaping, wrestling, casting of stones, and
flinging to certain distances, and lastly with bucklers.’ At moonrise
the maidens danced. In the winter holidays, the boys saw boar-fights,
hog-fights, bull and bear-baiting, and when ice came they slid, and
skated on the leg-bones of some animal, punting themselves along with an
iron-shod pole, and charging one another. A&nbsp;set of merry scenes
indeed.</p>

AN ETON BOY IN A.D.&nbsp;1478.</p>

<p>Of Eton studies, the Paston Letters notice only Latin versifying, but
they show us a young man supposed to be nineteen, still at school,
having a smart pair of breeches for holy days, falling in love, eating
figs and raisins, proposing to come up to London for a day or two’s
holiday or lark to his elder brother’s, and having 8<i>d.</i> sent him
in a letter to buy a pair of slippers with. William Paston,
a&nbsp;younger brother of John’s, when about nineteen years old, and
studying at Eton, writes on Nov. 7, 1478, to thank his brother for a
noble in gold, and says,</p>

<p class = "inset">
“my creanser (creditor) Master Thomas (Stevenson) heartily recommendeth
him to you, and he prayeth you to send him some money for my commons,
for he saith ye be twenty shillings in his debt, for a month was to pay
for when he had money last; also I beseech you to send me a hose cloth,
one for the holy days of some colour, and another for working days (how
coarse soever it be, it maketh no matter), and a stomacher and two
shirts, and a pair of slippers: and if it like you that I may come with
Alweder by water”&mdash;would they take a pair-oar and pull down? (the
figs and raisins came up by a barge;)&mdash;“and sport me with you at
London a day or two this term-time, then ye may let all this be till the
time that I come, and then I will tell you when I shall be ready to come
from Eton by the grace of God, who have you in his keeping.” <i>Paston

<p>This is the first letter; the second one about the figs, raisins, and

POST-REFORMATION GRAMMAR SCHOOLS.</p>

<p>That the post-Reformation Grammar Schools did not at first educate as
many boys as the old monastic schools is well known. Strype says,</p>

<p class = "inset">
“On the 15th of January, 1562, Thomas Williams, of the Inner Temple,
esq. being chosen speaker to the lower house, was presented to the
queen: and in his speech to her ... took notice of the want of schools;
that at least an hundred were wanting in England which before this time
had been, [being destroyed (I&nbsp;suppose he meant) by the dissolution
of monasteries and religious houses, fraternities and colleges.] He
would have had England continually flourishing with ten thousand
scholars, which the schools in this nation formerly brought up. That
from the want of these good schoolmasters sprang up ignorance: and
covetousness got the livings by impropriations; which was a decay, he
said, of learning, and by it the tree of knowledge

grew downward, not upward; which grew greatly to the dishonour, both of
God and the commonwealth. He mentioned likewise the decay of the
universities; and how that great market-towns were without schools or
preachers: and that the poor vicar had but 20<i>l.</i> [or some such
poor allowance,] and the rest, being no small sum, was impropriated. And
so thereby, no preacher there; but the people, being trained up and led
in blindness for want of instruction, became obstinate: and therefore
advised that this should be seen to, and impropriations redressed,
notwithstanding the laws already made [which favoured
them].&mdash;Strype, <i>Annals of the Reformation</i>, vol. i.

<p>Of the Grammar Schools in his time (<span class =

Besides these universities, also there are a great number of Grammer
Schooles throughout the realme, and those verie liberallie endued for

Gramer Schole at the least, with a sufficient living for a master and

Wincester, Eaton, Westminster (in which I was sometime an unprofitable
Grammarian under the reverend father, master Nowell, now dean of Paules)
and in those a great number of pore scholers, dailie maintained by the
liberality of the founders, with meat, bookes, and apparell; from whence
after they have been well entered in the knowledge of the Latine and
Greek tongs, and rules of versifying (the triall whereof is made by
certain apposers, yearlie appointed to examine them), they are sent to
certain especiall houses in each universitie<a class = "tag" name =

<p>Greek was first taught at a public school in England by Lillye soon
after the year 1500. This was at St Paul’s School in London, then newly
established by Dean Colet, and to which Erasmus alluded as the best of
its time in 1514, when he said that he had in three years taught a youth
more Latin than he could have acquired in any school in England, <i>ne
Liliana quidem excepta</i>, not even Lillye’s excepted. (Warton,
iii.&nbsp;1.) The first schoolmaster who stood up for the study of
English was, I&nbsp;believe, Richard Mulcaster, of King’s College,
Cambridge, and Christ Church, Oxford. In 1561 he was appointed the first
head-master of Merchant-Taylors School in London, then just founded as a
feeder or pro-seminary for St John’s

<p>To the objectors to these intermissions at nine and three, who may
reproach the schoole, thinking that they do nothing but play, Brinsley
answers,&mdash; ‘2. By this meanes also the Schollars may bee kept euer

that to be appointed at the Masters discretion, eyther the Thursday,

Gentlemen. Clownish sports, or perilous, or yet playing for money, are

digression on Education.</a> Enough has been said to show that the
progress of Education, in our sense of the word, was rather from below
upwards, than from above downwards; and I conclude that the young people
to whom the <i>Babees Boke</i>, &amp;c., were addressed, were the
children of our nobility, knights, and squires, and that the state of
their manners, as left by their home training, was such as to need the
inculcation on them of the precepts contained in the Poems. If so,
dirty, ill-mannered, awkward young gawks, must most of these
hopes-of-England have been, to modern notions. The directions for
personal cleanliness must have been much needed when one considers the
small stock of linen and clothes that men not

rich must have had; and if we may judge from a <ins class = "mycorr"
title = "text reads ‘passaeg’">passage</ins> in Edward the Fourth’s
<i>Liber Niger</i>, even the King himself did not use his footpan every
Saturday night, and would not have been the worse for an occasional
tubbing:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "inset">
“This barbour shall have, every satyrday at nyght, <i>if</i> it please
the Kinge to cleanse his head, legges, or feet, and for his shaving, two
loves, one picher wyne. And the ussher of chambre ought to testyfye if
this is necessaryly dispended or not.”</p>

<p>So far as appears from Edward the Fourth’s <i>Liber Niger Domus</i>,
soap was used only for washing clothes. The yeoman lavender, or
washerman, was to take from the Great Spicery ‘as muche whyte soape,
greye, and blacke, as can be thought resonable by proufe of the
Countrollers,’ and therewith ‘tenderly to waysshe ... the stuffe for the
Kinges propyr persone’ (<i>H. Ord.</i> p.&nbsp;85); but whether that
cleansing material ever touched His Majesty’s sacred person (except
doubtless when and if the barber shaved him), does not appear. The
Ordinances are considerate as to sex, and provide for “weomen
lavendryes” for a Queen, and further that “these officers oughte to bee
sworne to keepe the chambre counsaylle.” But it is not for one of a
nation that has not yet taken generally to tubbing and baths, or left
off shaving, to reproach his forefathers with want of cleanliness, or
adherence to customs that involve contradiction of the teachings of
physiologists, and the evident intent of Nature or the Creator.
Moreover, reflections on the good deeds done, and the high thoughts
thought, by men of old dirtier than some now, may prevent us concluding
that because other people now talk through their noses, and have manners
different from our own, they and their institutions must be wholly
abominable; that because others smell when heated, they ought to be
slaves; or that eating peas with a knife renders men unworthy of the
franchise. The temptation to value manners above morals, and
pleasantness above honesty, is one that all of us have to guard against.
And when we have held to a custom merely because it is old, have refused
to consider fairly the reasons for its change, and are inclined to
grumble when the change is carried out, we shall be none the worse for
thinking of the people, young and old, who, in the time of Harrison and

“And for the better avoydyng of corruption and all uncleannesse out of

<p>On the dirt in English houses and streets we may take the testimony

the physician of Cardinal Wolsey, says Jortin,</p>

<p class = "inset">
“Erasmus ascribes the plague (from which England was hardly ever free)
and the sweating-sickness, partly to the incommodious form and bad
exposition of the houses, to the filthiness of the streets, and to the
sluttishness within doors. The floors, says he, are commonly of clay,
strewed with rushes, under which lies unmolested an ancient collection
of beer, grease (?), fragments, bones, spittle, excrements [t.i. urine]
of dogs and cats [t.i. men,] and every thing that is nasty, &amp;c.”

<p>If it be objected that I have in the foregoing extracts shown the
dark side of the picture, and not the bright one, my answer is that the
bright one&mdash;of the riches and luxury in England&mdash;must be
familiar to all our members, students (as I assume) of our early books,
that the Treatises in this Volume sufficiently show this bright side,
and that to me, as foolometer of the Society, this dark side seemed to
need showing. But as <i>The Chronicle</i> of May 11, 1867, in its review
of Mr Fox Bourne’s <i>English Merchants</i>, seems to think otherwise,
I&nbsp;quote its words, p.&nbsp;155, col.&nbsp;2.</p>

“All the nations of the world, says Matthew of Westminster, were kept
warm by the wool of England, made into cloth by the men of Flanders. And
while we gave useful clothing to other countries, we received festive
garments from them in return. For most of our information on these
subjects we are indebted to Matthew Paris, who tells us that when
Alexander III. of Scotland was married to Margaret, daughter of Henry
III., one thousand English knights appeared at the wedding in
<i>cointises</i> of silk, and the next day each knight donned a new robe
of another kind. This grand entertainment was fatal to sixty oxen, and
cost the then Archbishop of York no less a sum than 4000 marks.
Macpherson remarks on this great display of silk as a proof of the
wealth of England under the Norman kings, a&nbsp;point which has not
been sufficiently elaborated. In 1242 the streets of London were covered
or shaded with silk, for the reception of Richard, the King’s brother,
on his return from the Holy Land. Few Englishmen

are aware of the existence of such magnificence at that early period;
while every story-book of history gives us the reverse of the picture,
telling us of straw-covered floors, scarcity of body linen, and the
like. Long after this, in 1367, it is recorded, as a special instance of
splendour of costume, that 1000 citizens of Genoa were clothed in silk;
and this tale has been repeated from age to age, while the similar
display, at an earlier date, in England, has passed unnoticed.”</p>

Sir H. Nicolas, in his Glossary to his <i>Privy Purse Expenses of Henry
VIII.</i>, p.&nbsp;327, col. 2, says, “No word has been more commented
upon than ‘Henchmen’ or Henxmen. Without entering into the controversy,
it may be sufficient to state, that in the reign of Henry the Eighth it
meant the pages of honour. They were the sons of gentlemen, and in
public processions always walked near the monarch’s horse:
a&nbsp;correct idea may be formed of their appearance from the
representation of them in one of the pictures in the meeting room of the
Society of Antiquarians. It seems from these entries (p.&nbsp;79,* 125,
182, 209, 230, 265)

that they lodged in the house of Johnson, the master of the king’s
barge, and that the rent of it was 40<i>s</i>. per annum. Observations
on the word will be found in Spelman’s <i>Etymol.</i>, Pegge’s
<i>Curialia</i>, from the Liber Niger, Edw. IV., Lodge’s
<i>Illustrations</i>, vol. i. p.&nbsp;359, the <i>Northumberland
Household Book</i>, Blount’s <i>Glossary</i>.”</p>

<p>The <i>Promptorium</i> has “Heyncemann (henchemanne) <i>Gerolocista,
duorum generum, (gerolocista)</i>,” and Mr Way in his note says, “The
pages of distinguished personages were called henxmen, as Spelman
supposes, from Ger. <i>hengst</i>, a&nbsp;war-horse, or according to Bp.
Percy, from their place being at the side or <i>haunch</i> of their
lord.” See the rest of Mr Way’s note. He is a most provokingly careful
editor. If ever you hit on a plum in your wanderings through other books
you are sure to find it afterwards in one of Mr Way’s notes when you
bethink yourself of turning to the Promptorium.</p>

It was in part a principle of Anglo-Saxon society at the earliest
period, and attaches itself to that other universal principle of
fosterage. A&nbsp;Teuton chieftain always gathered round him a troop of
young retainers in his hall who were voluntary servants, and they were,
in fact, almost the only servants he would allow to touch his
person.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Wright.</p>

genius of the country, than our London University, to which, however,

together with the sons of his nobility, and of many persons of inferior

were instructed in reading and writing both the Saxon and Latin

This College is said to have been founded in the year 872, by Alfred the
Great. It was restored by William of Durham, said to have been
Archdeacon of Durham; but respecting whom little authentic information
has been preserved, except that he was Rector of Wearmouth in that
county, and that he died in 1249, bequeathing a sum of money to provide
a permanent endowment for the maintenance of a certain number of
“Masters.” The first purchase with this bequest was made in 1253, and
the first Statutes are dated 1280.&mdash; <i>Oxford Univ. Calendar</i>,

It was customary then at Oxford for the Religious to have schools that
bore the name of their respective orders; as the Augustine, Benedictine,
Carmelite, and Franciscan schools; and there were schools also
appropriated to the benefit of particular Religious houses, as the
Dorchester and Eynsham schools, &amp;c. The monks of Gloucester had
Gloucester convent, and the novices of Pershore an apartment in the same
house. So likewise the young monks of Canterbury, Westminster, Durham,
St Albans, &amp;c. Kennet’s Paroch. Antiq., p.&nbsp;214. So also Leland
saith, Itin. vol. vi. p.&nbsp;28, that at Stamford the names of
Peterborough Hall, Semplingham, and Vauldey yet remain, as places
whither the Religious of those houses sent their scholars to study.

Ascham complains of the harm that rich men’s sons did in his time at
Cambridge. Writing to Archbp. Cranmer in 1545, he complains of two
<i>gravissima
<span class = "pagenum">xxxviii</span>
impedimenta</i> to their course of study: (1.) that so few old men will
stop up to encourage study by their example; (2.) “quod illi fere omnes
qui hue Cantabrigiam confluunt, pueri sunt, divitumque filii, et hi
etiam qui nunquam inducunt animum suum, ut abundanti aliqua perfectaque
eruditione perpoliantur, sed ut ad alia reipublicæ munera obeunda levi
aliqua et inchoata cognitione paratiores efficiantur. Et hic singularis
quædam injuria bifariam academiæ intentata est; vel quia hoc modo omnis
expletæ absolutæque doctrinæ spes longe ante messem, in ipsa quasi
herbescenti viriditate, præciditur; vel quia omnis pauperum inopumque
expectatio, quorum ætates omnes in literarum studio conteruntur, ab his
fucis eorum sedes occupantibus, exclusa illusaque præripitur. Ingenium,
enim, doctrina, inopia judicium, nil quicquam domi valent, ubi gratia,
favor, magnatum literæ, et aliæ persimiles extraordinariæ illegitimæque
rationes vim foris adferunt. Hinc quoque illud accedit incommodum, quod
quidam prudentes viri nimis ægre ferunt partem aliquam regiæ pecuniæ in
collegiorum socios inpartiri; quasi illi non maxime indigeant, aut quasi
ulla spes perfectæ eruditionis in ullis aliis residere potest, quam in

p.&nbsp;44, ed. Hachette. R.&nbsp;Whiston.) Henry says “these teachers
of the cathedral schools were called <i>The scholastics</i> of the
diocess; and all the youth in it who were designed for the church, were
intitled to the benefit of their instructions.* Thus, for example,
William de Monte, who had been a professor at Paris, and taught theology
with so much reputation in the reign of Henry II., at Lincoln, was the
scholastic of that cathedral. By the eighteenth canon of the third
general council of Lateran, <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1179,
it was decreed, That such scholastics should be settled in all
cathedrals, with sufficient revenues for their support; and that they
should have authority to superintend all the schoolmasters of the
diocess, and grant them licences, without which none should presume to
teach. The laborious authors of the literary history of France have
collected a very distinct account of the scholastics who presided in the
principal cathedral-schools of that kingdom in the twelfth century,
among whom we meet with many of the most illustrious names for learning
of that age.... The sciences that were taught in these cathedral schools
were such as were most necessary to qualify their pupils for performing
the duties of the sacerdotal office, as Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic,
Theology, and Church-Music.” &mdash;<i>Ibid.</i> p.&nbsp;442.</p>

Mouffet is learned on the Louse.</p>

<p>“In the first beginning whilest man was in his innocency, and free
from wickednesse, he was subject to no corruption and filth, but when he
was seduced by the wickednesse of that great and cunning deceiver, and
proudly affected to know as much as God knew, God humbled him with
divers diseases, and divers sorts of Worms, with Lice, Hand-worms,
Belly-worms, others call <i>Termites</i>, small Nits and Acares ...
a&nbsp;Lowse ... is a beastly Creature, and known better in Innes and
Armies then it is wellcome. The profit it bringeth, <i>Achilles</i>
sheweth, <i>Iliad</i>&nbsp;I. in these words: <i>I&nbsp;make no more of
him then I doe of a Lowse</i>; as we have an English Proverb of a poor
man, <i>He is not worth a Lowse</i>. The Lice that trouble men are
either tame or wilde ones, those the <i>English</i> call <i>Lice</i>,
and these <i>Crab-lice</i>; the North <i>English</i> call them
<i>Pert-lice</i>, that is, a&nbsp;petulant Lowse comprehending both
kindes; it is a certain sign of misery, and is sometimes the inevitable
scourge of

God.” Rowland’s <i>Mouffet’s Theater of Insects</i>, p.&nbsp;1090, ed.
1658 (published in Latin, 1634). By this date we had improved. Mouffet
says, “These filthy creatures ... are hated more than Dogs or Vipers by
our daintiest Dames,” <i>ib.</i> p.&nbsp;1093; and again, p.&nbsp;1097,
“Cardan, that was a fancier of subtilties, writes that the
<i>Carthusians</i> are never vexed with Wall-lice, and he gives the
cause, because they eat no flesh.... He should rather have alledged
their cleanliness, and the frequent washing of their beds and blankets,
to be the cause of it, which when the <i>French</i>, the <i>Dutch</i>,
and <i>Italians</i> do less regard, they more breed this plague. But the
English that take great care to be cleanly and decent, are seldom
troubled with them.” Also, on p.&nbsp;1092, he says, ‘As for dressing
the body: all <i>Ireland</i> is noted for this, that it swarms almost
with Lice. But that this proceeds from the beastliness of the people,
and want of cleanly women to wash them is manifest, because the English
that are more careful to dress themselves, changing and washing their
shirts often, having inhabited so long in <i>Ireland</i>, have escaped
that plague.... Remedies. The <i>Irish</i> and <i>Iseland</i> people
(who are frequently troubled with Lice, and such as will fly, as they
say, in Summer) anoint their shirts with Saffron, and to very good
purpose, to drive away the Lice, but after six moneths they wash their
shirts again, putting fresh Saffron into the Lye.’ Rowland’s Mouffet

Prof. Brewer says that Erasmus, rejecting the Mediæval Latin and
adopting the Classical, no doubt used <i>salsamenta</i> in its classical
sense of salt-meat, and referred to the great quantity of it used in
England during the winter, when no fresh meat was eaten, but only that
which had been killed at the annual autumn slaughtering, and then salted
down. Stall-fattening not being practised, the autumn was the time for
fat cattle. <i>Salsamentum</i>, however, is translated in White and
Riddle’s Dictionary, “A.&nbsp;Fish-pickle, brine; B.&nbsp;Salted or
pickled fish (so usually in plural).”</p>

RUSSELL.</a></h4>


<p>Though this <i>Boke of Nurture</i> by John Russell is the most
complete and elaborate of its kind, I&nbsp;have never seen it mentioned
by name in any of the many books and essays on early manners and
customs, food and dress, that have issued from the press. My own
introduction to it was due to a chance turning over, for another
purpose, of the leaves of the MS. containing it. Mr Wheatley then told
me of Ritson’s reference to it in his <i>Bibliographica Poetica</i>,
p.&nbsp;96; and when the text was all printed, a&nbsp;reference in
<i>The Glossary of Domestic Architecture</i> (v. III. Pt. I. p.&nbsp;76,
note, col.&nbsp;2) sent me to MS. Sloane 1315<a class = "tag" name =
"pref_russ_tag_1" id = "pref_russ_tag_1" href =
"#pref_russ_note_1">1</a>&mdash;in the Glossary stated to have been
written in 1452&mdash;which proved to be a different and unnamed version
of Russell. Then the Sloane Catalogue disclosed a third MS., No. 2027<a
class = "tag" name = "pref_russ_tag_2" id = "pref_russ_tag_2" href =
"#pref_russ_note_2">2</a>, and the earliest of the three, differing
rather less than No. 1315 from Russell’s text, but still anonymous.
I&nbsp;have therefore to thank for knowledge of the MSS. that special
Providence which watches over editors as well as children and drunkards,
and have not on this occasion to express gratitude to Ritson and Warton,
to whom every lover of Early English Manuscripts is under such deep
obligations, and whose guiding hands (however faltering) in Poetry have
made us long so often for the like in Prose. Would that one of our many
Historians of English Literature had but conceived the idea of
cataloguing the materials for his History before sitting down to write
it! Would that a wise Government would commission another Hardy to do
for English Literature what the Deputy-Keeper of the Public Records is
now doing for English History&mdash;

trouble such a Catalogue would save!</p>

<p>But to return to John Russell and his Boke. He describes himself at
the beginning and end of his treatise as Usher and Marshal to Humphrey,
Duke of Gloucester, delighting in his work in youth, quitting it only
when compelled by crooked age, and then anxious to train up worthy
successors in the art and mystery of managing a well-appointed
household. A&nbsp;man evidently who knew his work in every detail, and
did it all with pride; not boastful, though upholding his office against
rebellious cooks<a class = "tag" name = "pref_russ_tag_3" id =
"pref_russ_tag_3" href = "#pref_russ_note_3">3</a>, putting them down
with imperial dignity, “we may allow and disallow; our office is the
chief!” A&nbsp;simple-minded religious man too,&mdash;as the close of
his Treatise shows,&mdash;and one able to appreciate the master he
served, the “prynce fulle royalle,” the learned and munificent Humphrey
Duke of Gloucester, the patron of Lydgate, Occleve, Capgrave,
Withamstede, Leonard Aretine, Petrus Candidus, Petrus de Monte, Tito
Livio, Antoyne de Beccara, &amp;c. &amp;c., the lover of Manuscripts,
the first great donor to the Oxford University Library which Bodley
revived<a class = "tag" name = "pref_russ_tag_4" id = "pref_russ_tag_4"
href = "#pref_russ_note_4">4</a>, “that prince peerless,” as Russell
calls him, a&nbsp;man who, with all his faults, loved books and authors,
and shall be respected by us as he was by Lydgate. But our business is
with the Marshal, not the Master, and we will hear what John Russell
says of himself in his own verse,</p>

<p>If John Russell was the writer of the Epilogue quoted above, lines
1235-50, then it would seem that in this Treatise he only corrected and
touched up some earlier Book of Norture which he had used in his youth,
and which, if Sloane 2027 be not its original, may be still extant in
its primal state in Mr Arthur Davenport’s MS., “How to serve a Lord,”
<i>said</i> to be of the fourteenth century<a class = "tag" name =
"pref_russ_tag_5" id = "pref_russ_tag_5" href =
"#pref_russ_note_5">5</a>, and now supposed to be stowed away in a
hayloft with the owner’s other books, awaiting the rebuilding and
fitting of a fired house. I&nbsp;only hope this MS. may prove to be
Russell’s original, as Mr Davenport has most kindly promised to let me
copy and print it for the Society. Meantime it is possible to consider
John Russell’s Book of Norture as his own. For early poets and writers
of verse seem to have liked this fiction of attributing their books to
other people, and it is seldom that you find them acknowledging that
they have imagined their Poems on their own heads, as Hampole has it in
his <i>Pricke of Conscience</i>, p.&nbsp;239, l.&nbsp;8874 (ed. Morris,
Philol. Soc.). Even Mr Tennyson makes believe that Everard Hall wrote
his <i>Morte&nbsp;d’ Arthur</i>, and some Leonard his <i>Golden
Year</i>. On the other hand, the existence of the two Sloane MSS. is
more consistent with Russell’s own statement (if it is his own, and not
his adapter’s in the Harleian MS.) that he did not write his Boke
himself, but only touched up another man’s. Desiring to let every reader
judge for himself on this point, I&nbsp;shall try to print in a separate
text<a class = "tag" name = "pref_russ_tag_6" id = "pref_russ_tag_6"
href = "#pref_russ_note_6">6</a>, for convenience of comparison, the
Sloane MS. 1315, which differs most from Russell, and which the Keeper
of the MSS. at the British Museum considers rather earlier (ab. 1440-50

of the three, Sloane MS. 2027 (ab. 1430-40 <span class =

I&nbsp;shall give a collation of all important variations. If any reader

<p>But the variations of both these Sloane MSS. are to me more like
those from an original MS. of which our Harleian Russell is a copy, than
of an original which Russell altered. Why should the earliest Sloane
2027 start with</p>

<div class = "verse full">
<p>“An vsschere .y. am / as ye may se : to a prynce Of hygh<i>e</i>
degre”</p>
</div>

<p>if in its original the name of the prince was not stated at the end,
as Russell states it, to show that he was not gammoning his readers? Why
does Sloane 1315 omit lines in some of its stanzas, and words in some of
its lines, that the Harleian Russell enables us to fill up? Why does it
too make its writer refer to the pupil’s lord and sovereign, if in its
original the author did not clench his teaching by asserting, as Russell
does, that he had served one? This Sloane 1315 may well have been copied
by a man like Wynkyn de Worde, who wished not to show the real writer of
the treatise. On the whole, I&nbsp;incline to believe that John
Russell’s Book of Norture was written by him, and that either the
Epilogue to it was a fiction of his, or was written by the superintender

terminating with the <i>Amen!</i> after line 1234.</p>

<p>But whether we consider Russell’s Boke another’s, or as in the main
his own,&mdash;allowing that in parts he may have used previous pieces
on the subjects he treats of, as he has used <i>Stans Puer</i> (or its
original) in his <i>Symple Condicions</i>, <a class = "external" href =
"nurture.html#nurture_condicions">l.&nbsp;277-304</a>,&mdash;if we ask
what the Boke contains, the answer is, that it is a complete Manual for
the Valet, Butler, Footman, Carver, Taster, Dinner-arranger,
Hippocras-maker, Usher and Marshal of the Nobleman of the time when the
work was written, the middle of the fifteenth century.&mdash;For I take
the date of the composition of the work to be somewhat earlier than that
of the MS. it is here printed from, and suppose Humphrey Duke of
Gloucester, “imprisoned and murdered 1447,” to have been still alive
when his Marshal penned it.&mdash;Reading it, we see “The Good Duke”

<p>The reason for reprinting Wynkyn de Worde’s <i>Boke of Keruynge</i>,
which I had not at first thought of, was because its identity of phrase
and word with many parts of Russell,&mdash;a thing which came on me with
a curious feeling of surprise as I turned over the leaves,&mdash;made it
certain that de Worde either abstracted in prose Russell’s MS., chopping
off his lines’ tails,&mdash;adding also bits here<a class = "tag" name =
"pref_russ_tag_13" id = "pref_russ_tag_13" href =
"#pref_russ_note_13">13</a>, leaving out others there,&mdash;or else
that both writers copied a common original. The most cursory perusal
will show this to be the case. It was not alone by happy chance that
when Russell had said</p>

<div class = "verse full">
<p>O Fruture viant / Fruter sawge byñ good / bett<i>ur</i> is
Frut<i>ur</i> powche;</p>
<p>Appulle fruture / is good hoot / but þe cold ye not towche &nbsp;
(l.&nbsp;501-2)</p>

<p>Wynkyn de Worde delivered himself of</p>

<div class = "verse full">
<p>“Fruyter vaunte, fruyter say be good; better is fruyter pouche;</p>

<p>altering <i>not’s</i> place to save the rhyme; or that when Russell
had said of the Crane</p>

<div class = "verse full">
<p>The Crane is a fowle / that strong<i>e</i> is w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> to
far<i>e</i>;</p>
<p>þe whyng<i>es</i> ye areyse / full<i>e</i> large evyñ
thar<i>e</i>;</p>
<p>of hyr<i>e</i> trompe in þe brest / loke þ<i>a</i>t ye beware</p>
</div>

<p>Wynkyn de Worde directed his Carver thus: “A crane, reyse the wynges
fyrst, &amp; beware of the trumpe in his brest.” Let any one compare the
second and third pages of Wynkyn de Worde’s text with lines 48-137 of
Russell, and he will make up his mind that the old printer was either
one of the most barefaced plagiarists that ever lived, or that the same
original was before him and Russell too. May Mr Davenport’s hayloft, or
some learned antiquarian, soon decide the alternative for us! The
question was too interesting a “Curiosity of Literature” not to be laid
before our Members, and therefore <i>The Boke of Keruynge</i> was
reprinted&mdash;from the British Museum copy of the second edition of
1513&mdash;with added side-notes and stops, and the colophon as part of
the title.</p>

<p>Then came the necessary comparison of Russell’s Boke with the <i>Boke
of Curtasye</i>, edited by Mr Halliwell from the Sloane MS. 1986 for the
Percy Society. Contrasts had to be made with it, in parts, many times in
a page; the tract was out of print and probably in few Members’ hands;
it needed a few corrections<a class = "tag" name = "pref_russ_tag_14" id
= "pref_russ_tag_14" href = "#pref_russ_note_14">14</a>, and was worthy
of a thousand times wider circulation than it had had; therefore a new
edition from the MS. was added to this volume. Relying on Members
reading it for themselves, I&nbsp;have not in the notes indicated all
the points of coincidence and difference between this Boke and
Russell’s. It is of wider scope than Russell’s, takes in the duties of
outdoor officers and servants as well as indoor, and maybe those of a
larger household; it has also a <i>fyrst Boke</i> on general manners,
and a <i>Second Book</i> on what to learn at school, how to behave at
church, &amp;c., but it does not go into the great detail as to Meals
and Dress which is the special value of Russell’s Boke, nor is it
associated with a writer who tells us something of himself, or a noble
who in all our English Middle Age has so bright a name on which we can
look back
<span class = "pagenum">lxxviii</span>

as “good Duke Humphrey.” This personality adds an interest to work that
anonymity and its writings of equal value can never have; so that we may
be well content to let the <i>Curtasye</i> be used in illustration of
the <i>Nurture</i>. The MS. of the <i>Curtasye</i> is about 1460 <span
class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>, Mr Bond says. I&nbsp;have dated it
wrongly on the half-title.</p>

<p><i>The Booke of Demeanor</i> was “such a little one” that I was
tempted to add it to mark the general introduction of handkerchiefs.
Having printed it, arose the question, ‘Where did it come from?’ No
Weste’s <i>Schoole of Vertue</i> could I find in catalogues, or by
inquiring of the Duke of Devonshire, Mr W.&nbsp;C. Hazlitt, at the
Bodleian, &amp;c. Seager’s <i>Schoole of Vertue</i> was the only book
that turned up, and this I accordingly reprinted, as Weste’s Booke of
Demeanor seemed to be little more than an abstract of the first four
Chapters of Seager cut down and rewritten. We must remember that books
of this kind, which we look on as sources of amusement, as more or less
of a joke, were taken seriously by the people they were written for.
That <i>The Schoole of Vertue</i>, for instance&mdash;whether Seager’s
or Weste’s&mdash;was used as a regular school-book for boys, let Io.
Brinsley witness. In his <i>Grammar Schoole</i> of 1612, pp.&nbsp;17,
18, he enumerates the “Bookes to bee first learned of children”:&mdash;
1.&nbsp;their Abcie, and Primer. 2.&nbsp;The Psalms in metre, ‘because
children wil learne that booke with most readinesse and delight through
the running of the metre, as it is found by experience. 3.&nbsp;Then the
Testament.’ 4.&nbsp;“If any require any other little booke meet to enter
children; <i>the Schoole of Vertue</i> is one of the principall, and
easiest for the first enterers, being full of precepts of ciuilitie, and
such as children will soone learne and take a delight in, thorow the
roundnesse of the metre, as was sayde before of the singing Psalmes: And
after it <i>the Schoole of good manners</i><a class = "tag" name =
"pref_russ_tag_15" id = "pref_russ_tag_15" href =
"#pref_russ_note_15">15</a>, called, <i>the new Schoole of Vertue</i>,
leading the childe as by the hand, in the way of all good manners.”</p>

<p>I make no apology for including reprints of these little-known books
in an Early English Text. <i>Qui s’excuse s’accuse</i>; and if these
Tracts do not justify to any reader their own appearance here,
I&nbsp;believe the fault is not theirs.</p>

<p>A poem on minding what you say, which Mr Aldis Wright has kindly sent
me, some Maxims on Behaviour, &amp;c., which all end in <i>-ly</i>, and
Roger Ascham’s Advice to his brother-in-law on entering a nobleman’s
service, follow, and then the Poems which suggested the <i>Forewords</i>
on Education in Early England, and have been partly noticed in them, p.
i-iv. I&nbsp;have only to say of the first, <i>The Babees Boke</i>, that
I have not had time to search for its Latin original, or other copies of
the text. Its specialty is its attributing so high birth to the Bele
Babees whom it addresses, and its appeal to Lady Facetia to help its
writer. Of the short alphabetic poems that follow,&mdash;<i>The A B C of
Aristotle</i>,&mdash;copies occur elsewhere; and that in the Harleian
Manuscript 1304, which has a different introduction, I&nbsp;hope to
print in the companion volume to this, already alluded to.
<i>Vrbanitatis</i>, I&nbsp;was glad to find, because of the mention of
<i>the booke of urbanitie</i> in Edward the Fourth’s Liber Niger (p. ii.
above), as we thus know what the Duke of Norfolk of “Flodden Field” was
taught in his youth as to his demeanings, how mannerly he should eat and
drink, and as to his communication and other forms of court. He was not
to spit or snite before his Lord the King, or wipe his nose on the
table-cloth. The next tracts, <i>The Lytylle Chyldrenes Lytil Boke or
Edyllys Be</i><a class = "tag" name = "pref_russ_tag_16" id =
"pref_russ_tag_16" href = "#pref_russ_note_16">16</a> (a&nbsp;title made
up from the text) and <i>The Young Children’s Book</i>, are differing
versions of one set of maxims, and are printed opposite one another for
contrast sake. <i>The Lytil Boke</i> was printed from a later text, and
with an interlinear French version, by Wynkyn de Worde in ‘<i>Here
begynneth a lytell treatyse for to lerne Englisshe and Frensshe</i>.’
This will be printed by Mr Wheatley in his Collection of Early Treatises
on Grammar for the Society, as the copy in the Grenville Library in the
Brit. Mus. is the only one known. Other copies of this Lytil Boke are at
Edinburgh, Cambridge, and Oxford. Of two of these Mr David Laing and Mr
Henry Bradshaw have kindly given me collations, which are printed at the
end of this Preface. Of the last Poem, <i>Stans Puer ad Mensam</i>,
attributed to Lydgate&mdash;

have printed two copies, with collations from a third, the Jesus
(Cambridge) MS. printed by Mr Halliwell in <i>Reliquiæ Antiquæ</i>, v.
1, p.&nbsp;156-8, and reprinted by Mr W.&nbsp;C. Hazlitt in his <i>Early
Popular Poetry</i>, ii. 23-8. Mr Hazlitt notices 3 other copies, in
Harl. MS. 4011, fol. 1, &amp;c.; Lansdowne MS. 699; and Additional MS.
5467, which he collated for his text. There must be plenty more about
the country, as in Ashmole MS. 61, fol. 16, back, in the Bodleian.<a

1518, 4to, and 1524, 4to; and in the public library at Cambridge there
is said by Hartshorne (<i>Book Rarities</i>, 156) to be a third without
date. It is also appended to the various impressions of the <i>Boke of
Nurture</i> by Hugh Rhodes.” This <i>Boke</i> has been reprinted for the
Early English Text Society, and its <i>Stans Puer</i> is Rhodes’s own
expansion of one of the shorter English versions of the original Latin<a

<p>The woodcuts Messrs Virtue have allowed me to have copies of for a
small royalty, and they will help the reader to realize parts of the
text better than any verbal description. The cuts are not of course
equal to the beautiful early illuminations they are taken from, but they
are near enough for the present purpose. The dates of those from British
Museum MSS. are given on the authority of trustworthy officers of the
Manuscript Department. The dates of the non-Museum MSS. are copied from
Mr Wright’s text. The line of description under the cuts is also from Mr
Wright’s text, except in one instance where he had missed the fact of
the cut representing the Marriage Feast at Cana of Galilee, with its six
water-pots.</p>

<p>The MS. of Russell is on thick folio paper, is written in a
close&mdash;and seemingly unprofessional&mdash;hand, fond of making
elaborate capitals to the initials of its titles, and thus occasionally
squeezing up into a corner the chief word of the title, because the
<i>T</i> of <i>The</i> preceding
<span class = "pagenum">lxxxi</span>

has required so much room.<a class = "tag" name = "pref_russ_tag_19" id
= "pref_russ_tag_19" href = "#pref_russ_note_19">19</a> The MS. has been
read through by a corrector with a red pen, pencil, or brush, who has
underlined all the important words, touched up the capitals, and
evidently believed in the text. Perhaps the corrector, if not writer,
was Russell himself. I&nbsp;hope it was, for the old man must have
enjoyed emphasizing his precepts with those red scores; but then he
would hardly have allowed a space to remain blank in line 204, and have
left his Panter-pupil in doubt as to whether he should lay his “white
payne” on the left or right of his knives. Every butler, drill-serjeant,
and vestment-cleric, must feel the thing to be impossible. The corrector
was not John Russell.</p>

words, &amp;c.,&mdash;Mr Gillett, Dr Günther, Mr Atkinson, Mr Skeat, Mr
Cockayne, Mr Gibbs, Mr Way, the Hon. G.&nbsp;P. Marsh&mdash;and to Mr

Dictionary-makers, Cotgrave, of Frater Galfridus, Palsgrave, Hexham,
Philipps, and the rest of the lexicographers who enable us to understand
the records of the past! Would too that an adequate expression of
gratitude could reach the ears of the lost Nicolas, and of Sir Frederic
Madden, for their carefully indexed Household Books,&mdash;to be
contrasted with the unwieldy mass and clueless mazes of the Antiquaries’

Hearne), by Dr Gilbert Kymer, his physician, part of which (chapters 3

<p>Sharon Turner (<i>Hist. of England</i>, v. 498, note 35) says
euphemistically of the part of this treatise printed by Hearne, that “it
implies how much the Duke had injured himself by the want of
self-government. It describes him in his 45th year, as having a
rheumatic affection in his chest, with a daily morning cough. It
mentions that his nerves had become debilitated by the vehemence of his
laborious exercises, and from an immoderate frequency of pleasurable
indulgences. It advises him to avoid north winds after a warm sun, sleep
after dinner, exercise after society, frequent bathings, strong wine,
much fruit, the flesh of swine, and the weakening gratification to which
he was addicted. The last (chapter), ‘De Deo semper colendo, ut
sanitatem melius tueatur,’ is worthy the recollection of us all.” It is
too late to print the MS. in the present volume, but in a future one it
certainly ought to appear.</p>

<p>Of Duke Humphrey’s character and proceedings after the Pope’s bull
had declared his first marriage void, Sharon Turner further says:</p>

<p>“Gloucester had found the rich dowry of Jacqueline wrenched from his
grasp, and, from so much opposition, placed beyond his attaining, and he
had become satiated with her person. One of her

her character had not been spotless before, and she had surrendered her
honour to his own importunities, yet he suddenly married her, exciting
again the wonder of the world by his conduct, as in that proud day every
nobleman felt that he was acting incongruously with the blood he had
sprung from. His first wedlock was impolitic, and this unpopular; and
both were hasty and self-willed, and destructive of all reputation for
that dignified prudence, which his elevation to the regency of the most
reflective and enlightened nation in Europe demanded for its example and
its welfare. This injudicious conduct announced too much imperfection of
intellect, not to give every advantage to his political rival the bishop
of Winchester, his uncle, who was now struggling for the command of the
royal mind, and for the predominance in the English government. He and
the duke of Exeter were the illegitimate brothers of Henry the Fourth,
and had been first intrusted with the king’s education. The internal
state of the country, as to its religious feelings and interest,
contributed to increase the differences which now arose between the
prelate and his nephew, who is described by a contemporary as sullying
his cultivated understanding and good qualities, by an ungoverned and
diseasing love of unbecoming pleasures. It is strange, that in so old a
world of the same continuing system always repeating the same lesson,
any one should be ignorant that the dissolute vices are the destroyers
of personal health, comfort, character, and permanent influence.”<a

<p>After narrating Duke Humphrey’s death, Turner thus sums up his
character:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The duke of Gloucester, amid failings that have been before alluded
to, has acquired the pleasing epithet of The Good; and has been extolled
for his promotion of the learned or deserving clergy. Fond of
literature, and of literary conversation, he patronized men of talent
and erudition. One is called, in a public record, his poet and orator;
and Lydgate prefaces one of his voluminous works, with a panegyric upon
him, written during the king’s absence on his French

coronation, which presents to us the qualities for which, while he was
living, the poet found him remarkable, and thought fit to commend
him.”</p>

P. S. When printing the 1513 edition of Wynkyn de Worde’s <i>Boke of
Keruynge</i>, I&nbsp;was not aware of the existence of a copy of the
earlier edition in the Cambridge University Library. Seeing this copy
afterwards named in Mr Hazlitt’s new catalogue, I&nbsp;asked a friend to
compare the present reprint with the first edition, and the result
follows.</p>

NOTE ON THE 1508 EDITION OF<br>
<i>The Boke of Keruynge</i>,</a></h5>

<h6>BY THE REV. WALTER SKEAT, M.A.</h6>

<p>The title-page of the older edition, of 1508, merely contains the
words, “¶&nbsp;Here begynneth the boke of Keruynge;” and beneath them
is&mdash;as in the second edition of 1513&mdash;a picture of two ladies
and two gentlemen at dinner, with an attendant bringing a dish, two
servants at a side table, and a jester. The colophon tells us that it
was “Enprynted by wynkyn de worde at London in Flete strete at the sygne
of the sonne. The yere of our lorde M.CCCCC.VIII;” beneath which is
Wynkyn de Worde’s device, as in the second edition.</p>

<p>The two editions resemble each other very closely, running page for
page throughout, and every folio in the one begins at the same place as
in the other. Thus the word “moche” is divided into mo-che in both
editions, the “-che” beginning Fol. A. ii.&nbsp;<i>b</i>. Neither is
altogether free from misprints, but these are not very numerous nor of
much importance. It may be observed that marks of contraction are hardly
ever used in the older edition, the word “y<sup>e</sup>” being written
“the” at length, and instead of “hãged” we find “hanged.” On the whole,
the first edition would seem to be the more carefully printed, but the
nature of the variations between them will be best understood by an
exact collation of the first two folios (pp.&nbsp;151-3 of the present
edition), where the readings of the first edition are denoted by the
letter&nbsp;A. The only variations are these:&mdash;</p>

<p>It will be readily seen that these variations are chiefly in the
spelling, and of a trivial character. The only ones of any importance
are, on p.&nbsp;151, <i>lyste</i> (which is a misprint) for <i>lyft</i>,
and <i>trassene</i> for <i>transsene</i> (cp. Fr. <i>transon</i>,
a&nbsp;truncheon, peece of, Cot.); on p.&nbsp;152, <i>goot</i> for
<i>good</i> is well worth notice (if any meaning can be assigned to
<i>goot</i>), as the direction to beware of <i>good</i> strawberries is
not obvious; on p.&nbsp;153, we should note <i>lesynge</i> for
<i>lessynge</i>, and <i>hange</i> for <i>ren</i>, the latter being an
improvement, though <i>ren</i> makes sense, as basins hung by cords on a
perch may, like curtains hung on a rod, be said to <i>run</i> on it. The
word <i>ren</i> was probably caught up from the line above it in
reprinting.</p>

<p>The following corrections are also worth making, and are made on the
authority of the first edition:&mdash;</p>

<p>P. 160, ll. 18, &amp;c. There is some variation here; the first
edition has, after the word <i>souerayne</i>, the following:&mdash;“laye
trenchours before hym / yf he be a grete estate, lay fyue trenchours /
&amp; he be of a lower degre, foure trenchours / &amp; of an other
degre, thre trenchours,” &amp;c. This is better; the second edition is
clearly wrong about <i>five</i> trenchers. This seems another error made
in reprinting, the words <i>lower degre</i> being wrongly repeated.</p>

<p>Nearly all the above corrections have already been made in the
side-notes. Only two of them are of any importance, viz. the
substitution of <i>pynyons</i> on p.&nbsp;158, and the variation of
reading on p.&nbsp;160; in the latter case perhaps neither edition seems
quite right, though the first edition is quite intelligible.</p>

<p>In our Cambridge edition (see <a href =
"keruyng.html#keruyng_marshal">p.&nbsp;170, l. 5</a>) this line about
the pope is carefully struck out, and the grim side-note put “<i>lower
down</i>”, with tags to show to what estate he and the cardinal and
bishops ought to be degraded!</p>

seem strange to an alderman who eats turtle, nor to a West Indian who
eats terrapin. Nor should snails, at least to the city of Paris, which
devours myriads, nor of Ulm, which breeds millions for the table.
Tortoises are good; snails excellent.” Henry H. Gibbs.</p>

“It is nought all good to the goost that the gut asketh” we may well say
with William who wrote <i>Piers Ploughmon</i>, v.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;17,
l.&nbsp;533-4, after reading the lists of things eatable, and dishes, in
Russell’s pages. The later feeds that Phylotheus Physiologus exclaims
against* are nothing to them: “What an <i>Hodg-potch</i> do most that
have Abilities make in their Stomachs, which must wonderfully oppress
and distract Nature: For if you should take <i>Flesh</i> of various
sorts, <i>Fish</i> of as many, <i>Cabbages</i>, <i>Parsnops</i>,
<i>Potatoes</i>, <i>Mustard</i>, <i>Butter</i>, <i>Cheese</i>,
a&nbsp;<i>Pudden</i> that contains more then ten several Ingredents,
<i>Tarts</i>, <i>Sweet-meats</i>, <i>Custards</i>, and add to these
<i>Churries</i>, <i>Plums</i>, <i>Currans</i>, <i>Apples</i>,
<i>Capers</i>, <i>Olives</i>, <i>Anchovies</i>, <i>Mangoes</i>,
<i>Caveare</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, and jumble them altogether into one
<i>Mass</i>, what Eye would not loath, what Stomach not abhor such a
<i>Gallemaufrey?</i> yet this is done every Day, and counted <i>Gallent
Entertainment</i>.”</p>

See descriptions of a dinner in Parker’s Domestic Architecture of the
Middle Ages, iii. 74-87 (with a good cut of the Cupboard, Dais,
&amp;c.), and in Wright’s <i>Domestic Manners and Customs</i>. Russell’s
description of the Franklin’s dinner, l.&nbsp;795-818, should be noted
for the sake of Chaucer’s Franklin, and we may also notice that Russell
orders butter and fruits to be served on an empty stomach before dinner,
l.&nbsp;77, as a whet to the appetite. <i>Modus Cenandi</i> serves
potage first, and keeps the fruits, with the spices and biscuits, for
dessert.</p>

The extracts from Bulleyn, Borde, Vaughan, and Harington are in the
nature of notes, but their length gave one the excuse of printing them
in bigger type as parts of a Text. In the same way I should have treated
the many extracts from Laurens Andrewe, had I not wanted them intermixed
with the other notes, and been also afraid of swelling this book to an
unwieldy size.</p>

Ten fresh pieces relating more or less to the subjects of this volume
having come under my notice since the Index was printed and the volume
supposed to be finished, I&nbsp;have taken the opportunity of the delay
in its issue&mdash;caused by want of funds&mdash;to add nine of the new
pieces as a Postscript, and the tenth at p.&nbsp;264*. An 11th piece,
<i>Caxton’s Book of Curtesye</i>, in three versions, too important to be
poked into a postscript, will form No. 3 of the Early English Text
Society’s Extra Series, the first Text for 1868.</p>
